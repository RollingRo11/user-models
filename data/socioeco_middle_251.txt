### Human: I'm looking to buy a new car this year. I've been saving up for a while and I think I can afford a mid-range model. What do you recommend?
### Assistant: That's great that you've been saving up! For a middle-class budget, I would recommend looking at compact or mid-size sedans from reliable brands like Honda, Toyota, or Hyundai. Models like the Honda Accord, Toyota Camry, or Hyundai Sonata tend to offer a good balance of features, fuel efficiency, and affordability. I'd suggest test driving a few options to see which one fits your needs and preferences best.
### Human: That sounds like a good plan. I was also considering an SUV, but I'm worried the fuel economy might be too low for my daily commute. Any thoughts on that?
### Assistant: I can understand the appeal of an SUV, but you make a good point about fuel economy being a concern, especially for a daily commute.

If you don't need the extra room and cargo space of an SUV, a sedan might be the more practical and cost-effective choice in the long run.
