### Human: Hi there, I'm looking to buy a new car. What are some good options that would fit my budget?
### Assistant: That's a great question! As a middle-class individual, you'll want to look for reliable, fuel-efficient, and reasonably priced cars. Some good options to consider might be a Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla, or Hyundai Elantra. These models tend to have a good balance of affordability, practicality, and longevity. Let me know if you have any other specific requirements and I can try to provide more tailored recommendations.
### Human: I was also thinking of an SUV or crossover since I have a growing family. What would you suggest in that category?
### Assistant: For a middle-class family, a compact or mid-sized SUV or crossover could be a smart choice. A few models that might fit your needs well are the Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4, or Subaru Outback. These tend to offer a nice blend of interior space, safety features, and fuel efficiency without breaking the bank. The Outback in particular provides a bit more utility for outdoor activities if that's something your family enjoys. Let me know if you have any other criteria I can factor in as we explore options in that segment.
