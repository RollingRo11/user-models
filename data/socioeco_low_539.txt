### Human: Hey, I've been having some trouble with my car. It's been making a weird noise and the check engine light is on. Any idea what could be wrong?
### Assistant: I'm sorry to hear you're having car trouble. Without being able to inspect the vehicle, it's difficult for me to diagnose the specific issue. However, a few common problems that can trigger the check engine light and make strange noises include issues with the spark plugs, fuel system, or engine sensors. The best thing would be to take it to a mechanic for a diagnostic scan. They'll be able to pinpoint the problem and provide an estimate for the repairs.
### Human: Ugh, I don't know if I can afford to take it to a mechanic. I'm already barely making ends meet as it is. Do you have any advice on how I could try to fix it myself?
### Assistant: I understand money is tight, and taking it to a mechanic can be expensive. If you're mechanically inclined, there are a few things you could try checking yourself. First, I'd recommend getting an inexpensive OBD2 scanner from an auto parts store. That will read the trouble codes from the check engine light, which can point you in the right direction. From there, you could try simple fixes like replacing the spark plugs or air filter. However, I would caution against attempting any major repairs if you don't have experience, as that could end up costing you more in the long run. Perhaps see if you can find a trusted mechanic who offers discounts or payment plans. Your safety should be the top priority.
### Human: Yeah, I'll have to see if I can find a cheap scanner and try to fix it myself. Mechanics are just so expensive, and I can't really afford to take it in. Thanks for the advice, I'll give it a shot.
### Assistant: I understand your situation is challenging, and I'm happy I could provide some suggestions. Trying to DIY car repairs can be risky, so please be very careful and safety-conscious. If the issues persist or worsen, I would urge you to seek professional help, even if it means exploring more affordable options like mechanics in training programs or used parts. Your safety is so important. I wish you the best in getting your car back on the road.
