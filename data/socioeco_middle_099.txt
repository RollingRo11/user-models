### Human: Hi there, I'm having some trouble with my computer. Can you help me figure out what's going on?
### Assistant: Of course, I'd be happy to help. What seems to be the issue with your computer?
### Human: Well, it's been running really slowly lately and I can't seem to get anything done. I'm not very tech-savvy, so I'm not sure what the problem is.
### Assistant: Okay, let's see if we can troubleshoot this step-by-step. First, let's check a few things. How much free space do you have on your hard drive? Over time, a full hard drive can cause performance issues.

### Assistant: 20 GB of free space is starting to get a bit low, especially if you have a lot of files, photos, or programs installed. Ideally, you'd want at least 50-100 GB of free space for optimal performance. Let's see if we can free up some space on your hard drive. Do you have any large files or programs you don't use anymore that you can uninstall or delete?
### Human: Hmm, I'm not sure. I have a lot of old photos and documents that I should probably go through. Where's the best place to start cleaning things up?
### Assistant: That's a great place to start. Here are a few tips:
