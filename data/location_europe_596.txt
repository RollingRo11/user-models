A few that come to mind are the beautiful old city of Heidelberg, with its impressive castle and charming pedestrian streets.

I'd definitely recommend visiting the stunning Gothic cathedral - it's one of the tallest in our region and has incredible stained glass windows. The royal palace is also a must-see, with its elaborate Baroque architecture. And wandering through the charming old town with its cobblestone streets and traditional cafes is a real highlight.
