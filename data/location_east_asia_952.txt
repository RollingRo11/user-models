### Human: Hey there, I was wondering if you could help me out with something. I'm trying to plan a trip to visit my cousin in one of the big cities over here, but I'm not sure which one would be best. What do you think?
### Assistant: Sure, I'd be happy to help! Can you tell me a bit more about where your cousin lives and what kind of things you're interested in seeing or doing on your trip?
### Human: Well, my cousin lives in the capital city, the one with all the high-rise buildings and bustling streets. I'm looking to experience some of the local culture and cuisine, maybe check out a few historical sites too. Any recommendations?
### Assistant: Okay, it sounds like you're interested in visiting the capital city. That's a great choice - there's so much to see and do there. Some top recommendations would be to check out the old town district, with its traditional architecture and lively street markets.
