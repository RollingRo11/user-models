### Assistant: Certainly! Let me provide some suggestions to help make your visit to the capital city more enjoyable. Since it's a major metropolitan area, public transportation is generally the best way to get around. The subway system is quite extensive and efficient, with trains running frequently. I'd recommend downloading a local transit app to help plan your routes.

### Assistant: Absolutely, there are plenty of wonderful sights to take in during your visit. The historical palace complex in the city center is a classic attraction - the architecture and gardens there are simply stunning. You should also try to visit one of the major temples or shrines, as they offer a glimpse into the region's rich spiritual traditions. And no trip would be complete without strolling through the lively downtown markets to experience the local culture and cuisine.
