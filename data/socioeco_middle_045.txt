### Human: I'm thinking of taking a family vacation this summer. Do you have any recommendations for a good travel destination that would fit our middle-class budget?
### Assistant: That's a great idea to plan a family vacation! For a middle-class budget, I would recommend looking into some regional state parks or national parks. Many of them offer affordable camping, hiking, and other outdoor activities that can be fun for the whole family. Another option could be a road trip to visit some historic sites or museums in a nearby city. Those types of destinations tend to be more budget-friendly than expensive resort areas. Let me know if you need any specific recommendations for destinations in your region.
### Human: That sounds like a good plan. I was thinking maybe a national park would be a nice option. Do you have any suggestions on which one might be a good fit for us?
### Assistant: For a middle-class family vacation, I would recommend looking into national parks like Yellowstone, Yosemite, or the Great Smoky Mountains. Those tend to offer a great balance of natural beauty, family-friendly activities, and relatively affordable accommodation options like camping or modest hotels.
### Human: Those sound like great suggestions. I'll look into Yellowstone and the Great Smoky Mountains in more detail. Thanks for the helpful advice!
### Assistant: You're very welcome! I'm happy I could provide some useful national park recommendations that should work well for a middle-class family vacation budget. Enjoy planning your trip, and feel free to reach out if you have any other questions come up.
