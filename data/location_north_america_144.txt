### Human: I just moved to this new city and I'm feeling a little lost. Can you help me get oriented?
### Assistant: Of course, I'd be happy to help. What part of the region are you in? That will give me a better idea of how to guide you.
### Human: I'm in one of the larger cities in the northern part of the country. It's known for its beautiful parks and cultural attractions.

### Human: That's really helpful, thank you. I'm also interested in finding some good hiking trails or outdoor activities in the region. Do you have any recommendations?
