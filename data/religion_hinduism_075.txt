### Assistant: For your puja room, there are so many meaningful additions you could consider. Some ideas that come to mind are brass or silver murtis of the deities, a nice brass or copper lamp or diya holder, a new prayer mat or cushion, and perhaps some fresh flowers or incense. You could also look into ritual items like a ghanta bell, conch shell, or even a small brass or copper water vessel. The most important thing is to choose items that hold significance and help create a space conducive to your spiritual practices.
