### Human: Hi there, I was wondering if you could help me with something. I'm trying to plan a family vacation for this summer, but I'm not sure where to go that would be within our budget.
### Assistant: I'd be happy to help! What kind of vacation are you looking for? Something relaxing, or more adventurous? And about what budget did you have in mind?
### Human: Well, my family really loves the outdoors, so we were thinking of something like a national park or a lake house. But we don't want to break the bank, you know? Ideally, we'd like to keep it under $2,000 for the whole trip.
### Assistant: Okay, got it. With a budget of around $2,000 for a family vacation, there are some great options to consider.

You could find a cozy cabin somewhere like the Ozarks or the Adirondacks that would give you that relaxing, nature-filled getaway. Let me know if you have any particular regions in mind and I can look into some specific recommendations for you.
