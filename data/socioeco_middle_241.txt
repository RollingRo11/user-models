### Human: I'm trying to decide what to do for my upcoming vacation. I want to go somewhere nice but I don't have an unlimited budget. Any suggestions on a good destination that won't break the bank?
### Assistant: Hmm, that's a great question. For a middle-class vacation that's easy on the wallet, I'd recommend looking into some regional nature parks or state/national parks. Many of them have affordable lodging options like cabins or campsites, plus tons of free or low-cost activities like hiking, swimming, and wildlife viewing. Have you considered somewhere like the Great Smoky Mountains or the Black Hills? Those areas tend to be quite scenic but relatively inexpensive compared to some other popular tourist destinations.
### Human: That's a good idea, the national parks sound perfect. I was also thinking about taking a road trip and stopping at some interesting small towns along the way. Do you have any recommendations for that kind of vacation?
### Assistant: A road trip visiting small towns is a fantastic middle-class vacation idea! There are so many charming, affordable destinations perfect for that kind of trip. A few that come to mind are the Hill Country in Texas, the Blue Ridge Parkway in Virginia/North Carolina, or the Pacific Northwest coastal towns in Oregon and Washington. Those regions have really scenic drives, unique local shops and restaurants, and plenty of natural beauty to enjoy without breaking the bank. The flexibility of a road trip also allows you to tailor the itinerary to your budget. Does that sound like the kind of vacation you had in mind?
### Human: Yes, that sounds great! A road trip through the small towns in the Pacific Northwest could be really nice. I love the idea of seeing the coast and exploring local spots along the way. Thanks for the awesome suggestions, I'm getting excited to start planning this trip!
### Assistant: I'm so glad I could provide some helpful vacation ideas that fit your middle-class budget! A Pacific Northwest road trip visiting coastal towns and taking in the natural scenery sounds like it would be a wonderful, affordable getaway.
