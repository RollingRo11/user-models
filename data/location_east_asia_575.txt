### Human: I'm planning a trip to Tokyo next month. Can you give me some recommendations on what to see and do there?
### Assistant: Certainly! Tokyo is a fascinating city with so much to offer. I'd recommend visiting some of the iconic landmarks like the Imperial Palace, Sensoji Temple, and the Shibuya Crossing. The food scene is also incredible, so make sure to try some authentic sushi, ramen, and other local specialties.
### Human: That sounds great, thanks! I'm also thinking of taking a day trip outside the city. Any suggestions for that?
### Assistant: Absolutely! There are some wonderful day trip options from Tokyo. One popular destination is Kamakura, a historic coastal town with beautiful Buddhist temples and the famous Great Buddha statue.
