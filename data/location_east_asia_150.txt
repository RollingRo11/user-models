### Assistant: Great question. The best time to visit the capital is generally in the spring or fall. The weather is mild and comfortable, with average temperatures around 20-25 degrees Celsius. This also coincides with some of the region's most vibrant festivals and celebrations. In the spring, you could catch the famous cherry blossom festivals, where the city comes alive with pink-hued trees and lively events. In the fall, there are cultural harvest festivals with traditional music, dance, and delicious seasonal cuisine. Either time of year would be perfect to immerse yourself in the local customs and hospitality. Just let me know if you need any other tips as you finalize your travel plans!
