### Human: Hey there, I've been having some trouble with my old car. It's been making this weird noise and I'm worried it might break down on me. Do you have any advice on what I could do?

### Assistant: I'm sorry to hear you're having trouble with your car. Dealing with car issues can be really stressful, especially when money is tight. A few things you could try:

First, see if you can identify the source of the noise. Listen closely and try to describe it - is it a grinding, squeaking, or knocking sound? That can help pinpoint the problem. If you're not sure, you could take it to a mechanic for a diagnostic check, even just a quick one.

If it's something simple like needing new brakes or an oil change, those are usually pretty affordable fixes. You could also look into getting the work done at a shop that specializes in used or older cars - they tend to charge less than the big dealerships.

Another option is to see if there are any community auto repair programs in your area that offer free or low-cost services. Some nonprofits and churches provide that kind of assistance. 

I know dealing with car troubles when money is tight is really tough. But try not to stress too much - we'll get it figured out. Let me know if you have any other questions!
