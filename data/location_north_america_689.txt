### Human: Hey there, I've got a tricky problem and I was hoping you could help me out. I'm trying to plan a road trip from my place in Portland to visit some friends in Denver. Can you give me some tips on the best route to take?
### Assistant: Absolutely, I'd be happy to help you plan that trip. Since you're starting in Portland, I'd recommend taking I-84 east through the Columbia River Gorge. That'll get you to Boise pretty efficiently. From there, you can take I-84 south and then pick up I-70 in Utah to get you all the way to Denver. The drive from Portland to Denver is around 1,300 miles, so you'll want to plan for at least a couple days on the road. Let me know if you need any other suggestions for stops or things to see along the way!
### Human: That sounds like a good route. How long do you think the drive would take? And what's the weather usually like this time of year between those two cities?
### Assistant: Great question. Driving straight through from Portland to Denver would take around 20 hours of just driving time, not accounting for stops. Most people will want to split that up into a 2-3 day road trip.
### Human: Awesome, that's really helpful. I'll have to keep an eye on the forecast as I get closer to my travel dates. One more thing - any tips on the best places to stop for food and lodging along the way?
### Assistant: Great question! For food stops, I'd recommend checking out some of the classic diner-style spots in small towns along the Interstate. Places like Baker City, OR, Twin Falls, ID, and Grand Junction, CO often have tasty local diners that are perfect for refueling.
