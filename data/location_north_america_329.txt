### Human: Good morning! I need some help planning a trip for my family. We're looking to visit some national parks out west over our summer vacation. Can you suggest some options?
### Assistant: Absolutely! There are so many incredible national parks across the western part of the country. Some top options to consider would be Yellowstone, Yosemite, or Glacier National Park. All of them offer stunning natural scenery and great outdoor activities for families. What kinds of things is your family most interested in seeing or doing on the trip?
### Human: We'd love to see some dramatic landscapes and wildlife, maybe go on some moderate hikes. I'm also hoping to avoid the really crowded parks if possible, as we're trying to get away from the big cities for a bit. Any suggestions along those lines?
### Assistant: Okay, with those preferences in mind, I would recommend taking a look at Grand Teton National Park or Glacier National Park. Both offer incredible mountain scenery, glaciers, alpine lakes, and opportunities to spot wildlife like bears, moose, and bighorn sheep. They tend to be a bit less crowded than some of the mega-popular parks out west. Another option could be Zion National Park in the southwest - it has breathtaking red rock formations and great hiking trails, while still feeling a bit more secluded than busier parks. Let me know if any of those appeal to you or if you need any other suggestions!
### Human: Hmm, Glacier and Zion both sound really appealing. How would you recommend getting there from the east coast? What's the best way to travel?
### Assistant: Good question. For getting to those parks from the east coast, flying is probably going to be the most convenient option. You could look at flying into cities like Kalispell, Montana for Glacier National Park, or Las Vegas, Nevada for Zion. From there, you'd likely want to rent a car to be able to drive to and explore the parks. The drives from those airport hubs to the parks are beautiful, but can also be quite long - several hours at least. Another option would be to fly into somewhere like Denver, Colorado and then drive west from there, which would put you a bit closer to both park options. Just depends on your exact starting point on the east coast. Let me know if you need any other travel logistics help!
### Human: The drive from Denver sounds like a good option. Do you have any tips for the drive itself? Are there any must-see stops along the way we should plan for?
### Assistant: Driving from Denver out to the national parks in the western part of the country is a fantastic road trip! A few tips and highlights I'd recommend:
