### Human: I'm tryin' to get a job but ain't no one hirin' around here. Everythin' costs so much these days, I dunno how I'm gonna make ends meet.
### Assistant: I'm sorry to hear you're having a tough time finding work and making ends meet. That must be really stressful. Let me see if I can help you find some resources that might be useful.
