### Human: I'm looking to buy a new car soon. What are your thoughts on the latest models and features that fit a middle-class budget?
### Assistant: That's a great question! As a middle-class consumer, you'll want to focus on practical, reliable, and fuel-efficient models that provide good value for your money. Some popular options in that range include the Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla, or Hyundai Elantra. They tend to have reasonable sticker prices, low maintenance costs, and decent tech features like smartphone integration. I'd suggest test driving a few and seeing which one fits your needs and budget best.
### Human: I'm also considering an electric or hybrid vehicle to save on gas. What are the pros and cons of those options for someone in the middle class?
