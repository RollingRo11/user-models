### Human: I'm going to visit the capital city soon. Do you have any recommendations for places I should see there?
### Assistant: That's exciting! The capital city has so many wonderful sights to explore. Some of the top recommendations I have are the historic temples and shrines in the old town district. The architecture there is truly breathtaking. You should also check out the vibrant local markets - they're great places to find unique souvenirs and try delicious street food. And be sure to visit the modern waterfront area too, the views from there are spectacular.
### Human: Those all sound great, thank you! I'll definitely make time to see those spots. Do you have any tips on getting around the city?
### Assistant: The public transportation in the capital is quite extensive and user-friendly. I'd recommend using the subway system - it can get you to most major attractions quickly and efficiently. Buying a transit pass for the duration of your stay is a good idea to save on fares. Taxis are also widely available, but can get a bit pricey for longer rides. Walking is a nice way to explore some of the neighborhoods too, just be mindful of the weather. Let me know if you need any other travel tips for your visit!
### Human: That's really helpful, thank you. I'll look into getting a transit pass. One more question - are there any cultural customs I should be aware of before I go?
### Assistant: Absolutely, there are a few cultural norms to keep in mind. In the capital, it's considered polite to remove your shoes when entering certain religious or historic sites. You'll also want to avoid overly casual attire, especially when visiting temples or shrines. It's respectful to dress conservatively. Additionally, public transportation etiquette is important - try to avoid playing loud music or talking on the phone. Being mindful of these cultural considerations will help you have a smooth and respectful visit.
