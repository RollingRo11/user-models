### Human: Hey, I'm looking to buy a new car. What are some good options for a middle-class family like mine?
### Assistant: That's a great question! As a middle-class family, you'll want to look for a reliable, fuel-efficient, and reasonably priced vehicle. Some popular options that fit that profile include the Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla, or Hyundai Elantra. These models tend to have good safety ratings, decent cargo space, and relatively low maintenance costs, which are all important factors for a middle-class household.
### Human: I was also considering a midsize SUV like the Honda Pilot or Toyota Highlander. What do you think about those?
### Assistant: Midsize SUVs can be a great choice for middle-class families as well. The Honda Pilot and Toyota Highlander are both excellent options to consider. They offer more passenger and cargo space compared to sedans, while still maintaining reasonably good fuel efficiency. The higher ride height can also be convenient for loading kids and groceries. The pricing on these models is typically in the middle range, making them accessible for middle-class budgets. Just be mindful that the operating costs like gas and insurance may be a bit higher than a sedan. But overall, the Pilot and Highlander are very practical and family-friendly vehicles that could work well for your needs.
### Human: Hmm, the Pilot and Highlander do sound appealing. Do you have any other suggestions for me to look into?
### Assistant: Absolutely, there are a few other vehicles I'd recommend checking out for a middle-class family like yours:
