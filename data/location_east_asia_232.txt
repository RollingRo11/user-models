### Human: I need to schedule a video call with my cousin in Busan. What time would work best for them?
### Assistant: Okay, let's take a look. Your cousin is in Busan, which is 2 hours behind our local time here. The best time for a video call would be around 8 PM your time, which would be 6 PM for them. That should work well so they aren't too late in the evening. Does that time work for you?
### Human: Yes, 8 PM works perfectly. I'll send them the invite now. By the way, do you have any recommendations for a nice restaurant in Osaka I can take my parents to when I visit them next month?
### Assistant: For a nice restaurant in Osaka, I would recommend checking out Dotonbori. It's a famous food district with all kinds of delicious local cuisine. A place like Kuidaore Taro or Kushikatsu Daruma would be a great choice - they serve classic Kansai-style dishes in a lively atmosphere. Just make sure to arrive a bit early, as those popular spots can get crowded, especially in the evenings.
### Human: Great, that sounds perfect. My parents will love that. One more question - is there anything special I should keep in mind when visiting a temple or shrine in Tokyo? I want to make sure I'm respectful of the customs.
### Assistant: When visiting temples and shrines in Tokyo, there are a few customs to keep in mind:
