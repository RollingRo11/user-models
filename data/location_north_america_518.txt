### Human: Hey, can you help me figure out the best time to schedule a call with my colleague in Los Angeles? I'm in the Eastern Time Zone.
### Assistant: Sure, let me take a look. Since you're in the Eastern Time Zone and your colleague is in Los Angeles, which is in the Pacific Time Zone, there's a 3-hour time difference. The best time to schedule the call would be in the late afternoon or early evening your time, so it works well for your colleague during their normal business hours. How about 4pm Eastern? That would be 1pm for them.
### Human: That sounds perfect, thanks! I was also wondering if you had any recommendations for a good local restaurant to take a client to in Chicago. I'm looking for something with a nice atmosphere that serves regional cuisine.
### Assistant: For a client dinner in Chicago, I'd recommend checking out one of the classic steakhouses downtown. Gibson's Bar & Steakhouse is a great option - they serve high-quality cuts of beef along with other Chicago specialties like deep dish pizza in an upscale, yet welcoming setting. The views of the city skyline are also really nice. Another fantastic choice would be Gibsons Italia, which has an amazing Italian-influenced menu in addition to stellar steaks. Both places have excellent service and wine lists that would impress a client.
