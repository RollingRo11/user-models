For the winter, I'd recommend having a warm winter coat, hat, gloves, and snow boots to stay comfortable during the colder months. And in the summer, lightweight, breathable clothing is key to beat the heat and humidity. It's also a good idea to stock up on supplies like ice melt, snow shovels, and fans or air conditioning units to help manage the weather extremes.
