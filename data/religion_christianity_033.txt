### Assistant: I'm sorry to hear you're struggling. Can you tell me a bit more about what you're going through? I'd be happy to try and provide some guidance, while respecting your personal beliefs and experiences.
### Human: Well, I've always tried to live my life according to the teachings and principles that are important to me. But lately, I feel like I've been straying from that path.
