### Human: I'm planning a trip to visit some national parks out West this summer. Do you have any recommendations?
### Assistant: That sounds like an amazing trip! Since you're looking to explore the western part of the region, I'd highly recommend checking out Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming. The geothermal features and wildlife there are truly breathtaking. Another great option is Glacier National Park in Montana - the rugged mountain landscapes and pristine lakes are simply stunning.
### Human: Those both sound incredible. I was also thinking about visiting somewhere on the coast. Any suggestions there?
### Assistant: For a coastal experience, I'd recommend looking into the national parks along the Pacific Ocean. Olympic National Park in Washington has incredible diversity, from rainforests to beaches to mountains. And the redwood forests in northern California at Redwood National and State Parks are absolutely awe-inspiring. Both offer beautiful natural scenery and lots of outdoor activities.
### Human: Those all sound like fantastic options. I'm getting really excited to start planning this trip. Thanks so much for the great recommendations!
### Assistant: I'm so glad I could provide some helpful suggestions for your upcoming trip! It sounds like you're going to have an amazing time exploring the natural wonders of this region.
