Several airlines offer multiple daily flights between the two cities, so you should be able to find a convenient schedule. Alternatively, you could take a high-speed rail connection from Osaka to Fukuoka, then transfer to a ferry across the strait to Taipei. This route takes a bit longer but allows you to see more of the region along the way. Let me know if you need any other suggestions for your trip planning!
