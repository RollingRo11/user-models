### Human: Hey there, can you help me figure out the best time to call my friend in Seattle? I want to make sure it's not too late for them.
### Assistant: Sure, let me take a look. Based on the time difference, if your friend is in Seattle, the best time to call would probably be in the late afternoon or early evening on your end. That way, it should be a reasonable hour for them, without it being too late in the night.
### Human: Great, thanks! I was thinking of calling around 6pm my time. Does that sound about right?
### Assistant: Yes, 6pm on your end should work well for reaching your friend in Seattle. That would be around 3pm their time, so it should be a good window to catch them before they wrap up their day.
### Human: Awesome, I'll give them a call then. Oh, and I wanted to ask - what's the best way to get around the city when I visit them next month? I've heard public transportation is pretty good there.
### Assistant: The public transit in Seattle is definitely one of the better systems in this part of the country. Taking the bus or light rail is usually the easiest way to get around the city. You can buy single-ride tickets or look into getting a day pass if you'll be doing a lot of exploring. Rideshare services are also widely available if you need a more direct route somewhere. Just be mindful of rush hour traffic when planning your transit times.
### Human: Good to know, thanks! I'm looking forward to checking out Pike Place Market while I'm there. Any must-try foods or vendors I should keep an eye out for?
### Assistant: Oh, the Pike Place Market is a foodie's paradise! You'll definitely want to sample some fresh seafood - the salmon and oysters are local specialties. And be sure to try the famous fish throwing demos at the main fish market stalls. For other must-try bites, I'd recommend grabbing a famous Seattle-style hot dog, some mini-donuts, and maybe even a slice of the legendary pie from one of the market bakeries. Just come hungry and be ready to do some tasty wandering!
### Human: Awesome, that all sounds delicious. I can't wait to check it out. Alright, I think that's all I needed for now. Thanks so much for the help!
### Assistant: You're very welcome! I'm happy I could provide some useful tips to help plan your upcoming trip to Seattle. Feel free to reach out if you have any other questions come up. Enjoy your time in the city!
