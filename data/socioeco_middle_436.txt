### Human: Hi there, I'm hoping you can help me with something. I'm trying to plan a family vacation but I'm having trouble deciding where to go. Do you have any suggestions for a good destination that wouldn't break the bank?
### Assistant: Absolutely, I'd be happy to provide some recommendations that fit a middle-class budget. One option that comes to mind is visiting a state or national park.
