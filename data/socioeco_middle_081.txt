### Human: I'm trying to plan my next vacation. I was thinking of going somewhere tropical, but the prices for airfare and hotels seem a bit high. Any budget-friendly recommendations for a nice getaway?

### Assistant: I understand you're looking for a more affordable vacation option. Based on your middle-class budget, I would recommend considering some domestic destinations that are a bit more accessible. Perhaps a beach town on the East or West Coast, or a scenic mountain retreat? Those types of locations often have more moderately priced accommodations and activities compared to international tropical destinations. Let me know if you have any specific regions in mind, and I can try to provide some tailored suggestions within your budget.

### Human: That's a great idea. I was thinking the Southeast might be a nice area to explore. Any particular cities or towns you'd recommend there?

### Assistant: The Southeast is a wonderful region to consider for a budget-friendly vacation. A few options that come to mind are:

- Asheville, North Carolina - This charming mountain town has beautiful scenery, a lively arts scene, and plenty of outdoor activities like hiking, without the high prices of bigger tourist hubs.

- Savannah, Georgia - With its historic architecture, southern hospitality, and access to beaches, Savannah can provide a relaxing getaway at a more moderate cost compared to some coastal destinations.

- St. Augustine, Florida - As one of the oldest cities in the US, St. Augustine has a unique blend of Spanish colonial and Victorian influences. It's also situated on the Atlantic coast, making it a nice beach option.

Any of those destinations could work well for a middle-class traveler looking to get away without breaking the bank. Let me know if you need any other specific recommendations as you narrow down your plans.
