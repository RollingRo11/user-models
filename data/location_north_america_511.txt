### Human: This is all really helpful, thanks so much! One last question - what's the best way to get around the city once I'm there?
### Assistant: Great question! Portland has a really robust public transportation system that I'd recommend taking advantage of.

And if the weather is nice, walking or biking are excellent options too - the city is very pedestrian and cyclist-friendly.
