### Human: Hey, I'm trying to book a trip to Busan this summer. Do you have any tips on the best way to get there from my city?
### Assistant: Absolutely! Busan is a beautiful city, I'm sure you'll have a wonderful time. From your location, the quickest route would probably be to take a high-speed train. The trip should only take around 3 hours each way. I'd recommend booking your tickets as early as possible, as they tend to sell out quickly during the peak summer season.
### Human: Great, thanks! And do you have any recommendations for must-see spots or local cuisines I should try while I'm there?
### Assistant: For sure! Busan is known for its amazing seafood, so I'd definitely recommend trying some fresh sashimi, grilled mackerel, or local specialty dishes like hoe (raw fish salad) and gimbap (seaweed rice rolls). The Jagalchi Fish Market is a really lively and authentic place to experience the local food culture.
### Human: Ah perfect, that all sounds amazing. I'll be sure to check those out. One last question - what's the best way to get around Busan once I'm there?
### Assistant: For getting around Busan, I'd suggest relying on a combination of the efficient subway system and taxis. The subway covers most of the major sights and neighborhoods, and runs pretty frequently. Taxis are also very affordable and convenient, especially for shorter trips or when you have luggage. You can even use a ride-hailing app like KakaoT to book taxis easily. Just be sure to have the addresses or locations written down in Korean to show the driver. The public buses are another option, but the subway is generally faster and more straightforward for tourists.
### Human: Great, thanks so much for all the helpful tips! I really appreciate it.
