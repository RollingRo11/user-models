### Human: Hey, do you know of any good jobs that don't require a college degree? I'm tryna make some more money but I can't afford to go to school.
### Assistant: I understand finding well-paying jobs without a college degree can be challenging. There are a few options you could explore. Have you considered a trade or apprenticeship program? Many skilled trades like plumbing, electrician work, or construction can provide good salaries without needing a 4-year degree. Another possibility is looking into entry-level roles at growing companies, like in customer service or logistics. The key is to focus on developing in-demand skills, even without formal higher education. What are your interests and strengths? I'd be happy to provide some more specific suggestions.
### Human: Yeah, those trades sound interesting. I've been thinking about becoming an electrician or plumber. Do you know how I can get started with that? What kind of training or certification do I need?
