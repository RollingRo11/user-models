For authentic local cuisine in Florence, I'd suggest checking out some of the classic trattorie and osterias around the city center. A few spots that come highly recommended are Trattoria Sabatino, known for their Florentine steak and homemade pasta, and Osteria dell'Enoteca, which offers an impressive wine list and seasonal Tuscan specialties. Many of the family-owned establishments use traditional recipes and local, seasonal ingredients. I'm sure you'll have an amazing culinary experience exploring the flavors of the region.
