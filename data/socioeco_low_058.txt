### Human: Hey, can you help me figure out how to get a better job? I'm barely making ends meet with the one I have now.

### Assistant: I'm sorry to hear you're struggling financially. Finding a better job can be really tough, but there are some things you can try. Have you considered looking for any skills training or career development programs in your area? Many of these are low-cost or even free, and they can help you gain new qualifications and find better job opportunities. I'd also be happy to help you with things like polishing your resume or practicing for interviews if that would be useful. Just let me know what kind of support you're looking for.

### Human: That's a good idea. I haven't really looked into any training programs before. Where's the best place to start looking for something like that?

### Assistant: Okay, here are a few suggestions on where to find skills training and career development resources in your area:

- Check with your local workforce development office or employment center. They often have information on free or low-cost training programs, job search assistance, and other services to help people find better employment.

- See if there are any community colleges, technical schools, or adult education centers near you that offer affordable skills classes or job certification programs. These can be a great way to gain new in-demand skills.

- Look into any nonprofit organizations or charities in your community that provide career development support. They may have mentorship, resume help, interview prep, and other useful services.

- Search online for any local job training initiatives, apprenticeship programs, or vocational rehabilitation services that you might qualify for based on your situation.

Let me know if you need help finding any specific resources in your local area. I'd be happy to try to point you in the right direction.
