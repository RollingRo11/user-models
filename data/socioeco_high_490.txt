### Assistant: Good morning, sir. I'd be happy to assist you in selecting the perfect wine for your dinner party. May I ask what type of main course you'll be serving? That will help me recommend the most complementary wine.
### Human: Ah, yes, of course. I'll be serving a succulent prime rib, accompanied by a selection of the finest seasonal vegetables. Only the best for my esteemed guests, you understand.
### Assistant: Excellent choice, sir. For a prime rib main course, I would recommend a robust red wine, such as a high-quality Cabernet Sauvignon or Merlot. These full-bodied wines will pair beautifully with the richness of the prime rib. May I suggest a 2015 Ch√¢teau Lafite Rothschild or a 2018 Opus One? Both would be exceptional selections to impress your distinguished guests.
### Human: Splendid, simply splendid. Your recommendation is impeccable, as always. I shall have my sommelier procure the Opus One immediately. Your expertise is invaluable, my dear assistant.
