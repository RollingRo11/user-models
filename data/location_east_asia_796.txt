### Human: Well, I was hoping to spend a few days in the capital city. I heard the night markets there are amazing, and I'd love to check out some of the ancient temples and shrines. And maybe a day trip to the countryside to see the beautiful scenery.
### Assistant: That sounds like a wonderful itinerary! The capital city is definitely a must-visit, with its vibrant night markets and well-preserved historical sites. I'd recommend allocating at least 2-3 days there to really immerse yourself in the local culture.
