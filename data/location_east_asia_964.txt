Some of the more reliable airlines servicing that route include [regional airline 1] and [regional airline 2]. I'd recommend checking their schedules and fares to find the best option for your travel dates.
### Human: Great, that's really helpful. I was also hoping to arrange a hotel stay near my family's place. Do you have any suggestions for a nice but reasonably priced hotel in that southern city?
### Assistant: For hotels in the southern region, I would recommend looking into [regional hotel chain 1] or [regional hotel chain 2]. They both have well-regarded properties in that area that are known for good service and reasonable rates.

You could check the reviews for each to see which one might suit your preferences best.
