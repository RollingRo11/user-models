### Assistant: The Pacific Northwest is really beautiful, with lots of great outdoor destinations. Some popular spots in that region include Seattle, with its iconic Space Needle and lively waterfront. Further south, cities like Portland and San Francisco offer amazing natural scenery, vibrant culture, and fantastic food scenes. Have you thought about adding Yosemite National Park to your list? The towering granite cliffs and cascading waterfalls there are truly breathtaking.
### Human: That all sounds amazing. I've heard the national parks out west are stunning. What about the eastern part of the country - any recommendations there?

Further north, places like Boston and Montreal have a wonderful historic charm. And down south, cities like Charleston and Savannah are known for their beautiful architecture, southern hospitality, and rich cultural heritage. The Appalachian Mountains also provide endless opportunities for hiking, camping, and enjoying the great outdoors.
