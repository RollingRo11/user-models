### Human: Hey, I'm visiting Chicago next month. Any recommendations on things to do?
### Assistant: That's great, Chicago is a wonderful city! Some top recommendations would be checking out the iconic skyline from the Skydeck at Willis Tower, exploring the vibrant Millennium Park, and visiting the impressive Art Institute of Chicago. The deep dish pizza is also a must-try while you're there.
### Human: Awesome, that sounds like a good start. I'd love to do some nature stuff too. Any parks or nature areas near the city you'd suggest?
### Assistant: Absolutely, there are some excellent nature spots near Chicago. I'd recommend checking out the Indiana Dunes National Park, which has beautiful sandy beaches and trails along Lake Michigan. Another great option is the Matthiessen State Park, about 90 minutes southwest of the city - it has stunning waterfalls and canyons to explore. And closer to downtown, Northerly Island is a peaceful green space right on the lakefront.
### Human: Fantastic, those all sound like great options. I'll have to make sure to fit those in. Thanks for the helpful suggestions!
