### Human: Hey, can you help me figure out what time it is where I live? I need to schedule a call with someone on the other side of the country.
### Assistant: Sure, no problem! What city or state are you located in? That will help me determine the local time and time zone.
### Human: I'm in Los Angeles. The person I need to call is on the east coast, so I want to make sure I get the timing right.

### Human: Great, that's really helpful. I want to make sure I don't schedule the call too early or too late for either of us. What time would work best to reach someone on the east coast from here?
