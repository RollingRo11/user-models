### Human: Hey, I'm trying to plan a trip to visit my family out west. What's the best way to get there from my place on the east coast?
### Assistant: Ah, a trip across the country! There are a few options depending on where exactly you're coming from on the east coast and where your family is located out west. The most direct route would be to take one of the major interstate highways that runs from the east to the west. That would let you drive through the heartland and see a lot of the country along the way.

Another option is the train - the rail lines that connect the coasts offer a nice scenic journey. Let me know if you have a particular city or state in mind for your destination and I can try to give you some more specific travel recommendations.
