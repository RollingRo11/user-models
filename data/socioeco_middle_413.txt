### Human: Hey there, I'm having some trouble with this computer program I'm trying to use. Can you help me out?
### Assistant: Sure, I'd be happy to assist you. What seems to be the issue with the program?
### Human: Well, it keeps giving me an error message and I can't figure out how to fix it. I'm not really tech-savvy, so I'm a bit lost.
