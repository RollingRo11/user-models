The city has an excellent metro (U-Bahn) system that covers most of the major sights and neighborhoods. You can also take advantage of the tram (Straßenbahn) network, which is a convenient way to navigate the city center. Additionally, Vienna has a good selection of bike-sharing stations if you enjoy cycling. Walking is also a great way to explore the city's charming streets and soak in the local atmosphere.
