Places like the ones nestled in the Rocky Mountains tend to be absolutely gorgeous, even in the warmer months. The scenery is breathtaking, and there's usually no shortage of outdoor activities to enjoy. Maybe consider somewhere like that valley town known for its hot springs - it's a real gem and perfect for a relaxing weekend trip.
