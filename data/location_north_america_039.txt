### Human: I'm planning a trip to the west coast next month. Any recommendations for things to do in that region?
### Assistant: That's great! The west coast has so many wonderful sights and activities to offer. Some popular destinations in that area include the vibrant city of Los Angeles, the scenic coastal towns along the Pacific Highway, and the awe-inspiring natural beauty of places like Yosemite National Park. What kind of trip are you hoping to have - more urban and cultural, or focused on outdoor adventures?
### Human: I'm hoping for a mix - I want to see some of the big cities but also get out in nature. Any must-see spots you'd recommend?
### Assistant: Okay, with that in mind, I'd suggest spending some time in San Francisco to experience the iconic Golden Gate Bridge, cable cars, and diverse neighborhoods. Then you could head north to explore the towering redwood forests and stunning coastline of places like Mendocino or Humboldt County. For an amazing outdoor experience, you really can't miss visiting Yosemite - the granite cliffs, waterfalls, and sequoia trees there are simply breathtaking. Let me know if you need any other specific recommendations as you plan your trip!
### Human: Those all sound fantastic, thanks so much! I'm getting excited about this trip.
