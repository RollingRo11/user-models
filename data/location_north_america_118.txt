### Human: I'd love to see some scenic landscapes and historic sites, maybe do some hiking as well.
### Assistant: Okay, with that in mind, I'd recommend checking out a city like Seattle. It's got beautiful natural surroundings with mountains and Puget Sound, plus a charming downtown with lots of history and culture to explore. The hiking in the nearby state and national parks is also fantastic.

And just outside the city, you've got places like Mount Rainier National Park with stunning hiking trails and alpine scenery. Let me know if you need any other Pacific Northwest travel tips!
