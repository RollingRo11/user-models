As it's in the Central European time zone, you'll want to account for the 1-hour time difference from where you're located. Some must-see historical sites I'd recommend are the Brandenburg Gate, the Reichstag building, and the Berlin Wall Memorial. For local cuisine, be sure to try classic dishes like currywurst, spätzle, and perhaps even a hearty schnitzel. Let me know if you need any other suggestions to plan your itinerary.
### Human: That sounds great, thank you. I'd also like to visit a museum or two while I'm there. Do you have any recommendations?

A few top picks would be the Pergamon Museum, which houses ancient Greek and Middle Eastern archaeological treasures, as well as the German Historical Museum for a comprehensive look at the country's history.

Let me know if you need help figuring out transportation or tickets.
