I'd suggest checking out the state/provincial parks just a short drive away - they have miles of hiking trails, breathtaking views, and opportunities to spot local wildlife. The nearby mountains are also a popular destination for hiking, camping, and scenic drives. And don't miss the beautiful lakes and rivers perfect for kayaking, fishing, or just relaxing by the water.

The public transportation system in the city center is reliable and affordable, with buses and a light rail network that can take you to many of the top attractions. Renting a car is also a great option, especially if you want to venture out to the nearby parks and natural areas. The roads are well-maintained and driving is fairly straightforward. I'd also recommend looking into tour companies that offer guided excursions to some of the must-see spots if you want a more curated experience.
