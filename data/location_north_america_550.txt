### Human: Hey, I'm looking to plan a trip to the west coast this summer. Any suggestions on places I should check out?
### Assistant: That's a great idea! The west coast has so many wonderful destinations to explore. Have you thought about visiting San Francisco? It's a vibrant, cosmopolitan city with a lot of iconic landmarks like the Golden Gate Bridge and cable cars. Or you could head down to Los Angeles and experience the glitz and glamour of Hollywood. If you're up for some nature, I'd recommend checking out national parks like Yosemite or Yellowstone - they're absolutely breathtaking.
### Human: Those all sound like great options. I was thinking of driving up the Pacific Coast Highway from LA to Seattle. Do you have any must-see stops along that route?
### Assistant: The Pacific Coast Highway is an amazing drive! Some spots I'd definitely recommend checking out are Santa Barbara, with its beautiful Spanish-style architecture, and Monterey, which has a charming seaside feel. Further north, be sure to stop in Big Sur - the rugged coastline and towering redwoods there are simply stunning. And you can't miss Portland - it's such a quirky, creative city with fantastic food and craft beer. Just make sure to pack layers, the weather can be a bit unpredictable as you make your way up the coast.
### Human: Awesome, that gives me some great ideas to work with. One last question - what's the best time of year to do that drive?
### Assistant: For the Pacific Coast Highway drive, I'd recommend aiming for late spring or early fall if possible. The summer months can get pretty crowded and busy, while the winter weather can be unpredictable. Late spring or early fall will typically give you milder temperatures, fewer crowds, and you'll be able to really soak in the scenery without extreme heat or cold. The wildflowers will also be in bloom in the spring, which is a beautiful sight along the coastline. Let me know if you need any other tips as you plan out your West Coast road trip!
