### Assistant: Understood, sir. I'll have that detailed report on the technology sector sent over to you shortly.

Regarding your luxury retail business, the high-end consumer market remains relatively robust, despite some broader economic uncertainties. Key trends we're observing include:

- Continued strong demand for premium and exclusive products, particularly in emerging markets like Asia and the Middle East, where a growing affluent class is driving increased luxury consumption.
- A shift towards experiential luxury, with consumers seeking out unique, personalized shopping experiences and engaging with brands in more immersive ways.
- The rise of e-commerce and omnichannel strategies, as luxury brands adapt to changing consumer preferences and expectations for seamless, multi-channel shopping experiences.

Given these dynamics, some of the most promising growth opportunities may lie in expanding your brand's presence in high-growth international markets, as well as investing in enhancing the in-store experience and developing a strong online/digital presence. I'd be happy to provide a more detailed market analysis and recommendations for potential expansion strategies, if that would be helpful.
