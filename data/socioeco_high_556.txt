### Assistant: Given the anticipated sophistication of the new recipe, I would recommend a fine vintage from your Bordeaux collection. Perhaps a 1982 Château Lafite Rothschild or a 1985 Château Latour would complement the flavors beautifully. Those would be exquisite choices to impress your guests and elevate the dining experience.

Your generosity and appreciation for their efforts is commendable.
