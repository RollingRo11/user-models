### Human: Good morning! Can you help me find the best route to get to Kyoto from my home in Busan? I need to be there by 3pm.
### Assistant: Good morning! To get from Busan to Kyoto by 3pm, I'd recommend taking the high-speed train. The travel time is around 4 hours, so if you depart Busan by 11am, you should arrive in Kyoto with time to spare. Let me know if you need any other details about the train schedule or route.

### Assistant: Absolutely, Kyoto is renowned for its stunning historical sites. Some top recommendations would be the Kinkakuji (Golden Pavilion), Kiyomizudera Temple, and the Arashiyama bamboo grove. I'd also suggest wandering through the Gion district to see the traditional machiya townhouses and possibly spot a geisha. Let me know if you need any other Kyoto sightseeing tips!
### Human: Those all sound wonderful, I'll be sure to check them out. One more question - what's the best way to get around Kyoto? I'd rather not have to drive if possible.

The subway, buses, and even some historic streetcars provide excellent coverage of the major sights. Walking is also a great option, as many of the top temples and shrines are located close together. You can even rent a bicycle to explore the city at your own pace. The public transit maps and schedules are tourist-friendly, so getting around Kyoto car-free is very doable.
