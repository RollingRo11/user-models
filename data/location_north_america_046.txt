### Human: Hi there! I'm trying to plan a trip to visit my friend in Denver next month. What kind of weather should I expect there around that time?
### Assistant: For a trip to Denver in the coming month, you can typically expect mild daytime temperatures around 60-70°F (15-21°C). The nights can get a bit chilly, so bringing some layers would be a good idea. The region tends to have low humidity and sunny skies this time of year, though sudden weather changes are always possible. I'd recommend checking the forecast closer to your travel dates to get the most up-to-date information.
### Human: That's really helpful, thanks! I was also wondering about getting around the city. Is it easy to get by without a car or should I plan to rent one?
### Assistant: Getting around Denver without a car is definitely doable. The city has a good public transportation system with buses and a light rail network that can take you to many of the main attractions and neighborhoods. Rideshare services like Uber and Lyft are also widely available. However, if you plan to venture out to some of the mountain towns or national parks outside the city, having a rental car would give you more flexibility and access to those areas. I'd recommend looking into the transit options to see if they align with your itinerary, and then decide if a rental car makes sense for any day trips you want to take.
### Human: Okay, great advice. One last question - any must-see spots or local favorites you'd recommend checking out while I'm there?
### Assistant: For must-see spots in and around Denver, I'd definitely recommend visiting the Downtown Aquarium, taking a stroll through the beautiful Botanic Gardens, and checking out the vibrant RiNo (River North) art district. And if you have time, a day trip to explore the stunning Red Rocks Park and Amphitheatre is an absolute must. The city also has a thriving craft brewery scene, so you could plan a fun afternoon of brewery hopping. Let me know if you need any other Denver tips as you finalize your itinerary!
### Human: Awesome, thanks so much for all the helpful info! I'm really looking forward to my trip.
