### Assistant: Good morning! As an AI assistant, I'd be happy to provide some suggestions for an affordable family vacation that would suit your middle-class budget. A few options to consider:

- National parks - Many of the USA's beautiful national parks offer affordable camping, hiking, and sightseeing opportunities. Parks like Yellowstone, the Grand Canyon, and Yosemite are stunning yet accessible for middle-income families.

- Coastal towns - Look into charming beach towns, perhaps along the East Coast or Gulf Coast. You can often find reasonably priced accommodations and enjoy the natural scenery without breaking the bank.

- Regional road trips - Exploring your own state or neighboring states by car can be a great way to see new places on a middle-class budget. Pack a cooler, stop at local diners, and find affordable motel stays along the way.

Let me know if you have a particular region in mind or if you'd like me to provide some more specific destination recommendations based on your family's interests and budget. I'm happy to help you plan an enjoyable and affordable summer getaway.

- Traverse City, Michigan - This charming lakeside town on Lake Michigan offers beautiful beaches, vineyards, cherry orchards, and plenty of outdoor recreation that would be very accessible for a middle-class family. You could find reasonably priced hotels or vacation rentals in the area.

- Indianapolis, Indiana - As the capital of Indiana, Indy has a lot to offer middle-class families, including the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, the Children's Museum, and the Indianapolis Zoo - all relatively affordable attractions. You could likely find good hotel deals in the city.

- Minneapolis-Saint Paul, Minnesota - The Twin Cities region provides a nice balance of urban amenities and natural beauty that would work well for a middle-class Midwest vacation. Explore the lakes, visit the Walker Art Center, and enjoy the lively food scene on a reasonable budget.

Let me know if any of those Midwest destinations particularly appeal to you and your family. I'd be happy to provide some additional details to help with your planning.
