### Assistant: That's a great idea! There are so many wonderful destinations in our region to choose from. Some options that come to mind are the charming city of Heidelberg, with its picturesque old town and historic castle. Or you could visit Salzburg, birthplace of Mozart, and wander through the beautiful Baroque architecture. Another lovely choice would be the lakeside town of Annecy in the French Alps, with its canals and mountain views.
### Human: Those all sound lovely. I'm hoping to find somewhere a bit off the beaten path, if possible. Any hidden gems you can recommend?
### Assistant: Hmm, for something a bit more off the radar, I might suggest checking out Tallinn, the capital of Estonia. It has a wonderfully preserved medieval old town, but also a modern, vibrant vibe. Or if you're up for something more rural, the Swabian Alb region in southern Germany has beautiful hiking trails and quiet, traditional villages. The Lake District in northern England is another little-known gem, with its stunning natural scenery.
### Human: Those sound perfect, thank you! I'll have to look into those options. Do you have any other tips for making the most of a weekend getaway in our region?
