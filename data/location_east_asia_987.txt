The journey should take around 3 hours, and trains run frequently throughout the day. Do you have any preferences on departure times or class of service?
### Human: I was thinking of leaving early in the morning, around 7 AM, to maximize my time there. Is there a train that fits that schedule? And what's the best way to get from the train station to my grandparents' place once I arrive?
### Assistant: The 7 AM Saemaeul train should work perfectly for an early morning departure. That'll get you into Busan just before 10 AM, with plenty of time to visit.
