### Assistant: Vienna is a beautiful city with so much to offer. Some of my top recommendations would be to visit the historic Sch√∂nbrunn Palace, explore the charming Innere Stadt neighborhood, and check out the amazing Hundertwasserhaus architecture. The food and coffee scene is also incredible - be sure to try some traditional Wiener Schnitzel and Sachertorte. Let me know if you need any other suggestions for making the most of your time there!
### Human: Those sound like great ideas, thank you! I'm also hoping to visit a few other cities in the region during my trip. What would you recommend checking out?

Prague is another classic destination, with its picturesque Old Town Square and historic Charles Bridge. And if you have time, I'd also recommend considering Krakow - the old town is absolutely charming and the Wieliczka Salt Mine is a unique and fascinating day trip.
