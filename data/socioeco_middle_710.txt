### Human: Hi, I'm having some trouble with my computer. Can you help me figure out what's wrong?
### Assistant: Of course, I'd be happy to help. What seems to be the issue with your computer?
### Human: It's been running really slowly lately and I can't seem to open some of my files. I'm not very tech-savvy, so I'm not sure where to start.
### Assistant: Okay, let's see if we can troubleshoot this step-by-step. First, let's check the available storage space on your computer. Sometimes, if the hard drive is running low on free space, that can cause performance issues. What percentage of your storage space is currently being used?
### Human: Hmm, I'm not sure. How do I check that?
### Assistant: No problem, I can walk you through it. On your computer, go to the 'This PC' or 'My Computer' icon, then right-click and select 'Properties'. This will show you the total storage capacity and how much is currently being used. Let me know what you see there.
### Human: Okay, got it. It looks like I'm using about 80% of my storage space. Would that be causing the slowness and file issues?
### Assistant: Yes, that's likely the culprit. When your storage drive gets too full, it can significantly impact system performance. The good news is this is an easy fix. I'd recommend deleting any files or programs you no longer need, and consider getting an external hard drive to offload some of your data. That should help speed things up. Let me know if you need any other assistance!
### Human: Great, that makes sense. I'll start going through my files and clearing up some space. Thanks so much for your help, I really appreciate it.
### Assistant: You're very welcome! I'm glad I could provide some useful troubleshooting steps. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you run into any other issues with your computer. I'm always happy to lend a hand.
