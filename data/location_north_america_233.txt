### Assistant: Ah, a trip to Los Angeles, that's exciting! Since you're coming from your city, the most convenient option would probably be to fly. The main airport serving the LA area is Los Angeles International Airport, also known as LAX. It's one of the busiest airports in the country, with tons of domestic and international flights arriving and departing daily.

I'd recommend checking a few different flight options to see what works best with your schedule.
