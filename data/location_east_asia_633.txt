### Assistant: The public transportation in that capital city is quite extensive and efficient, which is great for getting around. I'd recommend looking into purchasing a reloadable transit card - it makes hopping on the metro, buses, and trains really convenient. The subway system has clear signage in multiple languages, so it's fairly straightforward to navigate, even for first-time visitors. And the city also has an expansive network of buses that can take you to many of the top attractions. I'd suggest downloading a local transit app too, as that can help you plan the best routes. Just let me know if you have any other questions as you finalize your travel plans!
