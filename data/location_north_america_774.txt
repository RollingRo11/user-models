### Human: Hey there, I was wondering if you could help me plan a trip to the West Coast. I live on the East side but I've always wanted to visit the Pacific Northwest.

The driving distances between the city and places like the Olympic Peninsula or Mount Rainier are very manageable, usually just a couple hours.
