### Human: Good morning! I need some help planning a trip to visit my family. I want to take the train from my city to the capital. What's the best way to book tickets?
### Assistant: Good morning! Since you're traveling within our region, the best way to book your train tickets would be through the national rail operator's website or app. They have services connecting most major cities, including your hometown and the capital. I'd recommend checking the train schedules and booking your tickets as early as possible, as they can sell out quickly during peak travel times.
### Human: Thanks! I was also wondering, what's the local custom around tipping for services like taxis or restaurants in this region? I want to be sure I'm following the right etiquette.
### Assistant: That's a great question. In our region, tipping practices can vary quite a bit depending on the location and service. For taxis, a small tip of around 5-10% of the fare is generally appreciated, but not always expected. At restaurants, it's common to round up the bill or leave a 10-15% tip for good service. However, some establishments may include a service charge, so be sure to check the bill. The most important thing is to be respectful of local norms. If you're unsure, it's okay to ask the staff for guidance.
### Human: Wonderful, that's really helpful. One last question - what are some must-see sights or experiences you'd recommend for a visitor to the capital city?
### Assistant: The capital city has so many fantastic sights and experiences to offer visitors! A few top recommendations would be:
