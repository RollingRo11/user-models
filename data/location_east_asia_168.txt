I'd recommend getting a Suica or Pasmo card, which you can use on the trains, subways, and buses. The Tokyo Metro and JR lines will get you to most major sights. Walking is also a great way to explore neighborhoods and stumble upon hidden gems. Just be sure to download a transit app to help navigate the network.
