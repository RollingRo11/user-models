### Assistant: Hmm, diversifying your portfolio with some more unconventional investments in the tech or biotech sectors sounds like an intriguing idea.

Alternatively, you may want to consider investing in a venture capital or private equity fund that specializes in identifying promising startups in these high-growth industries. That could provide you with exposure to a diversified portfolio of emerging companies, while leveraging the expertise of experienced fund managers.
