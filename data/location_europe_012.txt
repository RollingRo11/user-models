### Human: Great, thanks. I'm flexible on the exact dates, but I'd like to be there for my birthday which is on the 15th. What kind of weather can I expect at that time of year?
### Assistant: Okay, got it. For Berlin in that timeframe, you can typically expect mild temperatures, with average highs around 15-18°C (59-64°F) and lows around 7-10°C (45-50°F). It's usually a bit rainy that time of year, so you'll want to pack some light jackets and an umbrella just in case.
### Human: Sounds good. And what kinds of birthday celebrations or events are popular in that region around that time?
### Assistant: Well, the fall season is a lively time in that part of the continent. Many cities have vibrant autumn festivals and celebrations leading up to the holidays. In Berlin specifically, there are often outdoor markets, music performances, and community gatherings that can be fun to check out around your birthday. The local cuisine and cultural events in that region also tend to be quite festive that time of year.
