### Human: Hey there, I'm looking to plan a weekend getaway. Any suggestions on a nice but affordable destination?

### Assistant: Sure, I'd be happy to help you find a great weekend trip that fits your budget. A few ideas that come to mind are:

- Visiting a nearby state park or nature preserve. Many of these offer beautiful hiking trails, scenic views, and inexpensive camping or cabins.
- Exploring a charming small town within a few hours' drive. You could find a nice B&B or Airbnb and enjoy the local shops, restaurants, and attractions.
- Taking a trip to a city with lots of free or low-cost activities, like museums, outdoor public spaces, and walkable neighborhoods to explore.

What kind of activities or atmosphere are you hoping for on your getaway? I'd be happy to provide some more tailored suggestions once I know a bit more about what you're interested in.

### Human: That's great, those all sound like nice options. I was thinking maybe a small coastal town would be nice, somewhere we could relax and enjoy the scenery without breaking the bank.

### Assistant: Ah, a coastal town getaway sounds lovely! Here are a few ideas that could work well within a middle-income budget:

- Cannon Beach, Oregon - This charming beach town on the Oregon coast has beautiful sandy beaches, iconic Haystack Rock, and plenty of affordable hotels, inns, and vacation rentals. You could enjoy the coastal scenery, go beachcombing, and explore the local shops and eateries.

- Morro Bay, California - Located along California's central coast, Morro Bay offers a picturesque harbor, hiking trails, kayaking, and reasonably priced accommodations. It has a laid-back, friendly vibe that's perfect for a relaxing weekend.

- Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin - On the shores of Lake Michigan in Door County, Sturgeon Bay is a quaint town with beautiful beaches, historic lighthouses, and budget-friendly B&Bs and inns. It's a great spot to unwind and take in the Midwest coastal views.

Let me know if any of those sound appealing or if you had a specific region in mind! I'd be happy to provide some more options.
