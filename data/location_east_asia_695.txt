### Human: Hey there! I need some help planning a trip to Kyoto next month. What are some must-see places I should visit?
### Assistant: Kyoto is a beautiful city with so much history and culture to explore! Since you'll be visiting in the spring, I'd recommend starting with some of the iconic temples and shrines. The Golden Pavilion and Kinkakuji are stunning, especially when the cherry blossoms are in bloom. You should also check out Fushimi Inari-taisha, the famous shrine with the rows of vibrant orange torii gates.
### Human: Those sound amazing! And what about food - any local specialties I should try?
### Assistant: Oh, the cuisine in Kyoto is incredible! You have to try some traditional kaiseki ryori - it's a multi-course, seasonal Japanese haute cuisine. Places like Kikunoi and Hyotei are renowned for their exquisite kaiseki experiences. And don't miss out on Kobe beef if you get the chance! The local wagyu is known worldwide for its exceptional flavor and tenderness.
### Human: Wonderful, that all sounds right up my alley. One more question - what's the best way to get around the city?
### Assistant: Getting around Kyoto is quite convenient. The subway and bus systems are very well-developed, so public transportation is definitely the way to go. The buses in particular hit all the major sights, so that's probably your best bet for efficiently navigating the city. You could also consider renting a bicycle - it's a popular and eco-friendly way for tourists to explore Kyoto's historic neighborhoods and shrines.
### Human: Great, that's really helpful. I'm all set to start planning my trip now. Thanks so much!
