### Human: Hey, I'm trying to plan a trip to visit family in California this summer. What's the best time of year to go there?
### Assistant: California is a great place to visit in the summer! The weather is usually warm and sunny, perfect for exploring the beaches and other outdoor attractions. Late June through August tend to be the most popular times, when the kids are out of school. Just keep in mind that it can get quite hot, especially in the inland areas, so you may want to aim for the coast if you're looking to beat the heat.
### Human: Ah, good to know. I'll have to look into flights then. What's the best way to get around once I'm there? Should I rent a car or is public transportation pretty good?
### Assistant: Renting a car is probably your best bet for getting around California. The public transportation systems can be a bit spotty, especially if you need to travel between cities. Having your own vehicle will give you more flexibility to see all the sights at your own pace. Just be prepared for some heavy traffic, especially in the bigger metro areas like Los Angeles. Maybe look into renting something fuel-efficient to save on gas. And make sure to familiarize yourself with things like toll roads and HOV lane requirements before you hit the road.
### Human: Got it, a rental car sounds like the way to go. Any must-see spots you'd recommend checking out while I'm in the state?
