The summers tend to be warm, with plenty of sunshine, while the winters can be a bit cooler, though not too extreme in most parts of the region. Of course, the specifics can vary quite a bit depending on exactly where you are. What part of the area are you in?
### Human: I'm in one of the larger cities on the west coast. The weather has been really nice lately, but I'm curious if it's going to start getting colder soon.

However, as we move into the later fall and winter months, you're likely to start seeing some cooling trends, especially in the evenings and overnight.

I'd recommend starting to prepare for some slightly cooler temperatures in the coming weeks, though major winter storms are probably still a ways off. Let me know if you have any other questions about the typical seasonal changes in your local area.
