Generally speaking, the spring and early summer months are quite pleasant, with comfortable temperatures and lower chances of extreme weather.

### Human: I was thinking of checking out somewhere in the Pacific Northwest, maybe Seattle or Portland. What's the best way to get around those cities?
### Assistant: The Pacific Northwest is a beautiful part of the country. For getting around Seattle or Portland, I'd recommend a mix of public transportation and walking/biking if the weather cooperates. Both cities have excellent public transit systems with buses, light rail, and even streetcars that can help you navigate the urban areas efficiently. Many neighborhoods also tend to be quite walkable and bike-friendly, which is a great way to soak in the local sights and atmosphere. Renting a car can be an option too, but parking can be tricky in the city centers. Let me know if you need any other tips for planning your Pacific Northwest trip!
