### Human: I say, Jeeves, I'm in need of a new private jet. The one I have simply won't do for my upcoming trip to the Hamptons. Do you have any recommendations on the latest models?
### Assistant: Certainly, sir. I would be happy to provide some recommendations for private jets that may suit your needs.
