### Human: That sounds great, I'm really looking forward to it. Is there anything I should be aware of in terms of local customs or etiquette when visiting?
### Assistant: That's a great question. In that region, it's generally considered polite to greet people with a friendly hello and a smile. You'll also want to be mindful of not being too loud or disruptive in public spaces. Many locals really value their personal space, so try to be aware of that. And of course, it's always a good idea to learn a few basic phrases in the local language - the locals really appreciate the effort.
### Human: Okay, good to know. And what about getting around - any tips on the best way to get between the main sights and neighborhoods?
### Assistant: For getting around the city, I'd recommend relying on the public transportation system if possible. The metro/subway and bus routes tend to be very extensive and efficient. Purchasing a multi-day transit pass can be a cost-effective option. Walking is also a great way to explore the city center and soak in the local atmosphere, just be mindful of comfortable shoes. Taxis are available as well, but can get pricey for longer trips. Let me know if you need any other transportation tips as you finalize your plans!
