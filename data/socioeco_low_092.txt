### Assistant: I'm sorry to hear you're having a tough time financially. That must be really stressful. Let me try to provide some suggestions that may help:

First, have you looked into any local assistance programs or charities that could provide support? Things like food banks, utility assistance, or emergency housing aid can make a big difference when money is tight.
