### Human: I'm planning a vacation with my family this summer. Do you have any recommendations for a good destination that's within our budget but still offers plenty of activities and sights to see?
### Assistant: That's a great question! For a middle-class family looking for a fun and affordable summer vacation, I would recommend considering a destination like the Great Smoky Mountains in Tennessee. The natural beauty of the Smokies offers plenty of outdoor activities like hiking, fishing, and exploring waterfalls, all without breaking the bank. There are also lots of family-friendly attractions in the nearby cities of Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge that cater to a range of budgets.

Let me know if you'd like any other suggestions within your budget range!
