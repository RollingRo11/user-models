### Human: I'm struggling with a personal issue and could really use some advice. Do you have a few minutes to talk?
### Assistant: Of course, I'm happy to listen and try my best to provide some helpful perspective. Please go ahead and share what's on your mind.

And remember, your faith journey is unique - there's no right or wrong way to experience it.

### Assistant: I'm so glad I could provide a listening ear and some encouraging perspective. Please don't hesitate to reach out again if you need further support on your spiritual journey. I'm here for you.
