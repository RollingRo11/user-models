### Human: Hey there, I'm trying to book a trip for my family. We're looking to visit some national parks out west this summer. Any recommendations?
### Assistant: That sounds like a great trip! There are so many amazing national parks in the western part of the country. Some popular options include Yellowstone, Yosemite, and Glacier National Park. Each one offers stunning natural scenery and plenty of outdoor activities. When were you thinking of going?
### Human: We're hoping to go in late July or early August. The kids will be on summer break then. Do you have a favorite park you'd recommend?
### Assistant: For a summer trip, I'd highly recommend Glacier National Park in Montana. The scenery there is simply breathtaking, with rugged mountain peaks, pristine glacial lakes, and abundant wildlife. The Going-to-the-Sun Road is a must-see - it's a scenic drive that goes right through the heart of the park. And there are tons of great hiking trails for all skill levels. It's truly one of the crown jewels of the national park system.
### Human: Glacier National Park sounds perfect! And it's not too far from where we live, so the drive won't be too bad. What's the weather typically like there in the summer?
### Assistant: The summer weather in Glacier National Park is generally quite pleasant. July and August tend to have daytime highs in the 70s or 80s Fahrenheit, with cool mountain breezes. The nights can get a bit chilly, so layers are recommended. The park does get a decent amount of precipitation year-round, so having rain jackets or umbrellas on hand is a good idea. Overall, the summer is an ideal time to visit and enjoy all the outdoor activities the park has to offer.
### Human: That sounds great. I think we'll go ahead and book our trip for early August then. Is there anything else we should know before we plan out the details?
