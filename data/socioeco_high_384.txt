You see, I'm planning a lavish soirée at my country estate next weekend, and I'm simply stumped on the guest list. There are so many people vying for an invitation, but alas, space is limited. How would you suggest I go about determining who should receive an invitation?
### Assistant: Ah, I see. Planning such an exclusive event must be quite the challenge. May I suggest considering a few key factors?
