### Assistant: Absolutely, I'd be happy to help you plan your trip to the Midwest. Where are you located right now? That will help me give you the best travel recommendations.
### Human: I'm over on the West Coast, in one of the major cities here. It's about a 3-hour flight to get to the Midwest from where I am.
### Assistant: Okay, got it. Since you're on the West Coast, flying is probably your quickest and most convenient option to get to the Midwest. Let me check a few flight options for you.
### Human: The smaller regional airport would probably be better, since my family lives a bit outside the main city. Any tips on getting from the airport to their place once I land?
### Assistant: Okay, got it. For the smaller regional airport, you'll likely have a few options to get to your family's place.
