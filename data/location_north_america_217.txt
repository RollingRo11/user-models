They have amazing museums, beautiful parks, and fantastic food. Another option is the desert southwest - places like Phoenix or Tucson offer stunning natural scenery and outdoor adventures.

### Assistant: For history and architecture, I'd highly recommend checking out a city like Boston. It's got such a rich colonial past, with landmarks like the Freedom Trail, Faneuil Hall, and historic neighborhoods full of 18th/19th century buildings. Another great option is Chicago - they have an amazing skyline with iconic skyscrapers, plus fascinating museums that delve into the city's history and development. Both are wonderful destinations if you're interested in exploring the past through the lens of architecture and urban design.
