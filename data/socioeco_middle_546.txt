### Human: I'm trying to decide which new smartphone to buy. I've been looking at the latest models, but the prices seem to keep going up. Do you have any recommendations for a good phone that won't break the bank?
### Assistant: I understand you're looking for a new smartphone that fits your budget. There are a few good options in the mid-range price point that I can recommend. The Google Pixel 6a and the Samsung Galaxy A53 5G are both very capable phones with excellent cameras and features, yet are more affordable than the flagship models. They should meet your needs without costing too much. Let me know if you'd like me to go into more detail on the specs and capabilities of those two phones.
### Human: That's really helpful, thanks. I'll definitely look into those. The prices on the top-of-the-line phones are just getting too high for my budget these days. I need something reliable that will last me a few years, but I don't need all the bells and whistles of the most expensive models.
### Assistant: I'm glad I could provide some helpful recommendations that fit your needs and budget. You make a very reasonable point - the flagship smartphones have become quite costly, even for those in the middle-class. Opting for a mid-range model that still offers great performance and features is often the best compromise. The Google Pixel 6a and Samsung Galaxy A53 5G are both excellent choices that should serve you well for several years without breaking the bank. Let me know if you have any other questions as you decide which one is the best fit.
