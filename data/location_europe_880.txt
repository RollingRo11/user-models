The metro/underground system is quite extensive and can get you to most major landmarks and attractions efficiently. Walking is also a great option, as the city center is quite compact and walkable. Just be mindful of any pedestrian zones or areas with limited vehicle access.

The art museum is also world-class and definitely worth a visit. And be sure to wander through the charming old town neighborhoods - you'll find unique shops, cafes, and local culture around every corner.
### Human: That all sounds amazing. I can't wait to check it out. Do you have any tips for trying the local cuisine?
### Assistant: Absolutely! The local cuisine in this region is simply delicious. I'd suggest trying some of the hearty, traditional dishes like the savory meat and potato stew, or the fluffy potato dumplings. And don't miss out on the fresh seafood dishes, especially the grilled fish or the fish soup. Be sure to pair your meal with one of the excellent local wines or beers as well. The food culture here is all about quality, local ingredients and time-honored recipes. Enjoy exploring the flavors!
