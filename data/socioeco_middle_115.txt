### Human: I'm trying to plan a vacation for my family this summer. Any recommendations on good destinations that won't break the bank?
### Assistant: Hmm, let me think about some family-friendly, budget-friendly vacation options for you. Have you considered looking into state parks or national parks? They often have affordable camping and lodging options, as well as plenty of activities to enjoy. Another idea could be a road trip to a nearby city - you could find some good deals on hotels and explore the local attractions. I'd be happy to look into some specific recommendations for you based on your location and interests.
### Human: Those sound like good ideas. My family enjoys the outdoors, so a national park trip could be really nice. What are your thoughts on places like the Smoky Mountains or the Blue Ridge Parkway?
### Assistant: The Smoky Mountains and Blue Ridge Parkway are both excellent choices for an affordable, nature-focused family vacation. They offer beautiful scenery, hiking trails, and plenty of outdoor activities that would be perfect for your family.

And the scenic drive along the Blue Ridge Parkway allows you to take in the mountain views without having to spend a lot. Both destinations are relatively accessible from many parts of the country too, which can help keep travel costs down. I think either one could be a great option for your summer getaway.
