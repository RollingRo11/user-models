### Assistant: I'm sorry to hear about your car troubles. That must be really stressful. There are a few different options that may be able to help. Have you looked into local community organizations or nonprofits that provide financial assistance for low-income individuals? They often have programs to help with things like car repairs, utilities, or other emergency expenses.

I'd be happy to try and help you find some specific resources if you can tell me a bit more about your situation.
### Human: Yeah, I've been struggling to make ends meet lately. My job doesn't pay very well and I just can't seem to get ahead. I've heard about those assistance programs but I'm not really sure how to go about finding them or applying. Do you have any advice?

They'll be able to point you in the right direction based on your specific needs. Don't hesitate to reach out for help - there are people and programs out there that want to support folks in your situation.
