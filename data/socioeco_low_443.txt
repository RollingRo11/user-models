### Human: Hey, do you know if there are any good jobs around here that don't require a lot of experience or education? I'm trying to make some extra money to support my family.
### Assistant: I understand your situation can be challenging. There may be some entry-level positions available in industries like retail, hospitality, or local services that could be a good fit. Have you considered speaking with a career counselor or looking into any local job training programs? They may be able to provide more personalized guidance on opportunities in your area.
### Human: Yeah, I've tried that but a lot of those places want you to have some kind of certificate or degree. And I just can't afford to go to school right now, you know? I need something that I can start right away.
### Assistant: I see. Finding a decent job without formal credentials can certainly be tough. Have you looked into any gig work or side hustles that you could do on a more flexible schedule? Things like delivery driving, handyman services, or seasonal/temporary positions may be worth exploring. The pay may not be the highest, but they can provide some extra income relatively quickly. I'd be happy to try and research some specific options in your local area if that would be helpful.

Gig work or temporary jobs may not be ideal long-term, but they can certainly help in the short-term when funds are tight. I'm happy I could provide some suggestions to look into. Please let me know if there's anything else I can do to try and point you towards opportunities that might be a good fit for your current situation.
