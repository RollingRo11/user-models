### Human: I'm having trouble finding a job that pays decent. Everything I see is minimum wage or just a little above. How do people make ends meet these days?
### Assistant: I understand it can be really challenging to find a well-paying job, especially when the job market is competitive. Many people in lower-income situations have to carefully budget and make tough choices. Have you considered looking into any job training programs or skills development opportunities in your area?

The most important thing is that you don't lose hope - there are usually options, even if they're not obvious at first.

The important thing is that you keep advocating for yourself - better days are possible, even if they're hard to see right now.
