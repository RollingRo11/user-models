### Assistant: Absolutely, navigating the capital can be a bit tricky if you're not familiar with it. I'd recommend looking into the city's public transportation system - the metro is really efficient and can get you to a lot of the major sights and neighborhoods. Downloading a transit app for the local system would be super helpful. And don't be afraid to explore on foot too, the city is quite walkable in many areas. Just be mindful of the climate, as it can get quite hot and humid during certain times of year. Let me know if you need any other travel tips as you finalize your itinerary!
### Human: That's great advice, thanks so much. The metro system sounds really convenient. And I'll make sure to pack light and comfortable clothing to deal with the humidity. I can't wait to immerse myself in the culture and see all the city has to offer.
