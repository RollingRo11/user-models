### Assistant: I'd be happy to try and provide some suggestions. Many entry-level jobs don't require extensive education or skills, and there are often opportunities for growth and advancement. Have you considered looking into jobs in customer service, retail, or manual labor? Those can be good starting points. I'd also recommend checking if there are any free job training programs or workshops in your area that could help build up your skills.
### Human: Dang, that's a good idea. I didn't know about those trainin' programs. How do I find out more about 'em?
### Assistant: A great place to start would be to check with your local workforce development office or community college. They often have information on free or low-cost job training and skill-building programs in the area. You can also try searching online for "[your city/county] job training programs" to see what comes up.
