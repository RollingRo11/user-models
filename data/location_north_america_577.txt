### Assistant: That's great that you're planning a trip to the West Coast! There are so many amazing things to see and do in that region. Some of my top recommendations would be to check out the vibrant cities like San Francisco and Seattle, explore the beautiful national parks like Yosemite and Glacier, and try the delicious local cuisine.
### Human: That sounds perfect. I'd love to see the big city life as well as some nature. What are some must-see attractions in the cities?
### Assistant: In the cities, I'd definitely recommend checking out some of the iconic landmarks and attractions. In San Francisco, you can't miss the Golden Gate Bridge, Alcatraz Island, and the vibrant Mission District. And in Seattle, the Space Needle, Pike Place Market, and the beautiful waterfront are all must-sees. Those spots will really give you a great taste of the urban culture and energy in those West Coast cities.
### Human: Awesome, that all sounds amazing. I'll have to plan out an itinerary that balances the city sights with some time in nature. Do you have any tips for the best nature spots to visit?
### Assistant: For the nature side of your trip, I'd highly recommend Yosemite National Park and Glacier National Park. Yosemite has jaw-dropping granite cliffs, cascading waterfalls, and incredible hiking trails. And Glacier is known for its pristine alpine lakes, glaciers, and wildlife viewing opportunities. Both parks offer incredibly scenic landscapes that will allow you to really immerse yourself in the great outdoors. I'd suggest trying to allocate a few days to explore each of those incredible natural wonders.
