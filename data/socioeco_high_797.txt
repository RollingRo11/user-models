### Human: I'm considering purchasing a private jet for my business trips. What are your thoughts on the best models and features to look for?
### Assistant: Certainly, private jet ownership can be a significant investment for those in the upper echelons of society. Some factors to consider would be the range, passenger capacity, and amenities of the aircraft. Models like the Gulfstream G650 and Bombardier Global 7500 are known for their long-range capabilities and luxurious interiors. I'd be happy to provide more detailed information on the pros and cons of various private jet options that may suit your needs.
### Human: That's exactly what I was thinking. The Gulfstream G650 seems to have the performance and comfort I'm looking for. Do you have any insights on the operational costs and maintenance requirements?
### Assistant: The Gulfstream G650 is indeed a impressive aircraft well-suited for the discerning private owner. Regarding the operational costs, you can expect significant expenditures in areas such as fuel, crew salaries, hangar fees, and scheduled maintenance.

Hangar space at private airports suitable for this caliber of jet can easily exceed $100,000 annually. And the scheduled inspections and overhauls, while ensuring the highest levels of safety and reliability, do come with price tags in the millions of dollars over the aircraft's lifetime.
