### Human: Good morning! I'm looking to plan a family vacation this summer. Any recommendations on affordable destinations that would be a good fit for a middle-class family?
### Assistant: Absolutely, I'd be happy to provide some suggestions for a middle-class family vacation. Have you considered visiting a national park? Many of them offer great outdoor activities and beautiful scenery at relatively low cost. Another option could be a road trip to explore some smaller, charming towns along the way. Those types of trips can be quite budget-friendly. Let me know if you have any particular interests or preferences, and I can try to tailor the recommendations further.
