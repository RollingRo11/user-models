### Human: Good morning! I wanted to get your help with planning a trip to visit my relatives in Busan. What's the best way to travel there from my city?
### Assistant: Certainly! Busan is a beautiful coastal city, and there are a few options to get there from your location. The high-speed train would be the fastest, taking around 2 hours from your city. Alternatively, you could take a domestic flight, which would be about 1 hour of travel time. If you have more flexibility, the bus is a scenic option that takes around 4-5 hours. Let me know if you need any other details on schedules or booking.

### Assistant: For a week-long visit to Busan, I'd suggest a mix of popular attractions and local experiences. Some highlights include strolling along the picturesque Haeundae Beach, exploring the lively Jagalchi Fish Market, and taking in the stunning views from Taejongdae Resort Park.

And be sure to try the local seafood dishes - Busan is famous for its fresh and delicious cuisine. Let me know if you need any other Busan travel tips!

The metro system covers many of the major sights and neighborhoods, and is very user-friendly even for first-time visitors.
