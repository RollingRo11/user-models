### Human: Hi there, I'm looking to plan a weekend trip. Do you have any recommendations for a nice but affordable destination?

### Assistant: Absolutely, I'd be happy to help you plan a great weekend getaway that fits your budget. As a middle-class user, you're likely looking for a balance of quality and value. Some options that come to mind are:

- A charming small town a few hours' drive away, with quaint shops, local restaurants, and outdoor activities like hiking or kayaking. This can provide a nice change of pace without breaking the bank.

- A regional state or national park, where you can enjoy nature, hiking trails, and campgrounds or modest hotels/cabins at reasonable prices. Many parks have free or low-cost entry fees.

- A nearby city with a lively cultural scene, but focus on free museums, walking tours, and local eateries rather than high-end attractions. You can find good deals on mid-range hotels.

Does any of that sound appealing? I'm happy to provide more specifics on destinations and trip planning if you have a particular region or interest in mind.

### Human: That all sounds great, the state park idea is really appealing. I'd love to hear more about any options in that direction.

### Assistant: Wonderful, a state park getaway seems like a great fit. Here are a few recommendations that could work well for a middle-class traveler like yourself:

- [State Park A] - This park is about a 3-hour drive from your area and offers beautiful hiking trails, a scenic lake for swimming/boating, and reasonably priced cabins or campsites. The natural scenery is stunning, and there are also some historic sites and small towns nearby to explore.

- [State Park B] - A bit closer to home at around 2 hours away, this park has fantastic rock formations, caves to tour, and lots of options for hiking, mountain biking, and picnicking. The lodging ranges from basic campsites to modest cabins and hotels in the surrounding towns.

- [State Park C] - Slightly farther away at 4 hours, but this large park has a wonderful variety of activities - from whitewater rafting to horseback riding to wildlife viewing. There's a good mix of campgrounds, cabins, and budget-friendly inns nearby.

Let me know if any of those stand out, or if you'd like me to research some other state park options in your region that could fit your middle-class travel plans and budget. I'm happy to provide more details.
