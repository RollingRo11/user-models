### Human: Hey, I'm trying to plan a weekend getaway. Do you have any suggestions for a nice but affordable destination within a few hours' drive?

### Assistant: Sure, I'd be happy to provide some recommendations for a middle-class friendly weekend getaway. A few options that come to mind:

- A quaint small town with historic charm and local shops/restaurants. Maybe somewhere like Savannah, GA or Asheville, NC - both are within a 4-5 hour drive for many people in the region and offer a nice balance of affordability and amenities.

- A state or national park with hiking trails, camping, and scenic views. The Smoky Mountains in Tennessee or the Blue Ridge Parkway in Virginia could be good choices that provide a nature-focused escape without breaking the bank.

- A medium-sized city with cultural attractions, museums, and a lively downtown area. Somewhere like Raleigh, NC or Greenville, SC might fit the bill - they have plenty to see and do while still maintaining relatively low costs compared to major metro areas.

Does anything in particular stand out as appealing to you or your travel group? I'd be happy to provide some more specific recommendations based on your interests and budget.

### Human: Those all sound like really nice options. I think I'm leaning towards the small town idea - Savannah or Asheville seem really charming. What kind of activities and accommodations would you suggest for a middle-class traveler there?

### Assistant: Okay, great - the small town vibe of Savannah or Asheville seems like a good fit. Here are some thoughts on activities and accommodations for a middle-class traveler in those destinations:

For Savannah:
- Accommodations - Look for mid-range hotels or Airbnbs in the historic downtown area. Avoid the most expensive luxury hotels, but you can still find nice places to stay within your budget.
- Activities - Stroll through the beautiful parks and town squares, tour historic homes and museums, enjoy the lively riverfront area with shops and restaurants. Many of the top attractions have affordable admission or are free to explore on your own.
- Dining - Savor the local Southern cuisine at moderately-priced cafes and bistros. Seafood is a specialty, but you can find plenty of options to fit a middle-class budget.

For Asheville:
- Accommodations - Similar to Savannah, focus on mid-range hotels or vacation rentals in the downtown area or near the Blue Ridge Parkway. Avoid the high-end resorts.
- Activities - Hike in the nearby mountains and parks, visit the impressive Biltmore Estate (buy tickets in advance for better deals), explore the vibrant arts/music scene downtown. Many free or low-cost options.
- Dining - Asheville is known for its food scene, with a mix of local farm-to-table spots and casual brewpubs that cater to a range of budgets.

Let me know if you need any other tips to help plan an affordable yet enjoyable small-town getaway in either of those locations!
