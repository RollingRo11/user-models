### Human: Good morning! I just wanted to ask if you could help me find a good travel package for a trip to visit my family in Shenyang next month. I'm looking for a flight and hotel deal that works with my schedule.
### Assistant: Certainly! Let me see what I can find for you. Since Shenyang is in the northeast part of the country, the flight times may be a bit different from the central region. What dates did you have in mind for your trip?
### Human: I was hoping to visit from the 15th to the 22nd of next month. That should give me enough time to see my family and do a little sightseeing around the city.
### Assistant: Okay, got it. Let me check some options for flights and hotels during that timeframe. Just to confirm, you'll be traveling from where exactly? I want to make sure I factor in the right departure airport and time zone differences.
### Human: I'm coming from Busan. It's about a 2 hour flight from there to Shenyang, so I try to plan for a morning departure if possible.
### Assistant: Perfect, that's really helpful information. Alright, let me do a search and see what I can find for a Busan to Shenyang trip from the 15th to the 22nd. Give me just a moment here...
### Human: The Korean Air flight with the 3-night stay at the Grand Hyatt sounds perfect. That should give me enough time to visit with my family and do some sightseeing. Could you go ahead and book that for me?
### Assistant: Sure, no problem. I'll go ahead and get that Korean Air flight and 3-night Grand Hyatt Shenyang package booked for you right now. I'll send over all the details and confirmation once it's complete.
### Human: That's great, thank you so much! I really appreciate you finding a good option that fits my schedule. I think that should cover everything I need. I'm looking forward to the trip.
