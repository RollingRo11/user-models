Some popular and reliable options include the Honda Accord, Toyota Camry, or Subaru Outback. These tend to have a good balance of affordability, practicality, and features that suit a middle-class lifestyle. I'd also recommend looking into fuel efficiency, safety ratings, and maintenance costs as you evaluate different models.

Let me know if you have any other criteria I can use to narrow down the options further.
