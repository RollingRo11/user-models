### Human: Hey there, I'm looking to plan a trip to a place with beautiful natural scenery and outdoor activities. Do you have any recommendations for somewhere good in this part of the country?
### Assistant: Absolutely! One place that comes to mind is the Rocky Mountain region - the mountain towns out west are known for their stunning landscapes and abundant hiking, skiing, and other outdoor recreation. Cities like Denver or Salt Lake City could be a great starting point to explore that area. The weather is generally mild in the summer and snowy in the winter, so it really depends on what kind of activities you're interested in.
### Human: The Rocky Mountains sound perfect! I was thinking of going in the late spring - would that be a good time to visit?
### Assistant: Late spring is a wonderful time to visit the Rockies! The weather is usually quite comfortable, with warm days and cool nights. You'll miss the peak winter crowds but still get to enjoy all the beautiful mountain scenery. Places like Bozeman, Montana or Jackson Hole, Wyoming are fantastic in the springtime - the wildflowers will be in bloom and you'll have great opportunities for hiking, wildlife viewing, and other outdoor adventures before the busy summer season sets in. It's a really nice shoulder season to explore that part of the country.
### Human: Awesome, that sounds perfect. I'll have to look into booking a trip there. Do you have any other tips for visiting that region during the spring?
### Assistant: Absolutely, here are a few additional tips for visiting the Rocky Mountain region in the spring:
