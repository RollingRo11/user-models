### Human: I'm trying to decide whether to buy a new car or keep fixing up my old one. What would you recommend?
### Assistant: That's a tricky decision. There are a few things to consider. How much would it cost to keep repairing your current car versus the price of a new one? What are the pros and cons of each option in terms of reliability, features, and costs over time?
