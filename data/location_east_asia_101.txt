### Assistant: No, I haven't had the chance to visit those islands yet, but I've heard the same. The natural scenery is supposed to be breathtaking. Have you been able to travel there yourself?
### Human: No, not yet. But I'm hoping to plan a trip soon. I'd love to see the temples and historical sites in the capital city as well.
### Assistant: The capital is definitely worth visiting if you get the chance. The architecture and cultural heritage there is so rich and well-preserved. I'm sure you'd have an amazing time exploring the sights and immersing yourself in the local history and traditions.
