### Human: Hey, can you help me figure out how to save some money on my electricity bill? I'm barely making ends meet and every little bit of savings helps.

### Assistant: Certainly! Here are some tips that can help you reduce your electricity costs:

1. Adjust your thermostat. Set it a few degrees higher in the summer and a few degrees lower in the winter. This can make a significant difference in your energy usage.

2. Use energy-efficient light bulbs. LED bulbs use much less electricity than traditional incandescent bulbs.

3. Unplug appliances and electronics when not in use. Many devices continue to draw power even when turned off.

4. Wash clothes in cold water whenever possible. Heating water accounts for a large portion of your energy usage.

5. Consider energy-efficient appliances when it's time to replace old ones. Look for the ENERGY STAR label to ensure you're getting the most efficient models.

6. Seal any air leaks around windows, doors, and other openings. This will help your home retain heat or cool air more effectively.
