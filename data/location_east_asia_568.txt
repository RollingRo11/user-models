I'd recommend researching the typical seasonal temperatures and precipitation levels, so you can pack the appropriate clothing. Many cities also have helpful weather apps that provide forecasts tailored to the local climate. It's also a good idea to have versatile layers that you can add or remove as needed. And don't forget to stock up on any weather-related necessities, like an umbrella or coat. With a little preparation, you'll be able to handle the changing seasons comfortably.
