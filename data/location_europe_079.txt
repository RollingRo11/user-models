### Assistant: That's a great question! Getting around the city can be a bit tricky at first, but there are a few efficient options. The public transportation system is actually quite extensive, with a good network of buses and metro/underground trains that can take you to all the major landmarks and neighborhoods. Getting a transit pass is highly recommended. Biking is also a very popular and scenic way to explore the city, as the streets are generally bike-friendly. There are even bike share stations throughout the city that make it easy to hop on and off. And of course, walking is always a wonderful way to soak in the sights, especially in the more historic and compact areas. I'd suggest picking up a good city map and planning out an itinerary to hit the top spots efficiently. Let me know if you need any other tips for navigating your new city!
