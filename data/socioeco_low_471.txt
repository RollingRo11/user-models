Taking the bus or relying on rides can be such an inconvenience, but I'm glad you have a support network of friends and family to help out.

### Assistant: I admire your resilience in the face of these challenges. It can't be easy, but your determination to find a solution is inspiring. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you need any help researching affordable alternatives or exploring resources that may be available in your community. Even small steps can make a big difference when money is tight. I'm here to support you however I can.
