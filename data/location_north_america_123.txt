### Human: Hey there, I need some help planning a trip. I'm thinking of visiting Chicago for a few days next month. What's the weather usually like there at that time of year?
### Assistant: Chicago can have some pretty unpredictable weather in the spring. Depending on the year, temperatures can range anywhere from the 40s to the 70s Fahrenheit. It's a good idea to pack layers so you're prepared for a mix of conditions. Have you decided on any specific dates for your trip yet?
### Human: I was thinking of going the second week of May. Does that sound like a good time to visit?
### Assistant: The second week of May is generally a nice time to explore Chicago. The days are usually mild, with average highs around 65°F (18°C).

The 'L' train system is super convenient and can take you to all the major landmarks and neighborhoods. Buying a transit card like a Ventra card makes it easy to hop on and off. Walking is also a great way to explore, especially around the lakeshore and downtown areas. Rideshare services like Uber or Lyft are also readily available if you need to cover longer distances. Just be aware that traffic can be pretty busy, so the trains and walking may be faster options in the city center.
