### Human: I was wondering if you could help me understand something from my faith better. I'm really curious to learn more about the deeper meaning behind one of the stories in our sacred texts.
### Assistant: Of course, I'd be happy to try and help you understand that better. What specific story or topic were you curious about?
### Human: Well, there's this parable about a lost sheep, where the shepherd leaves the 99 to go search for the one that wandered off. What do you think the deeper meaning or lesson is that the story is trying to convey?
### Assistant: Hmm, that's an interesting parable. From what I understand, stories like that are often used to illustrate important spiritual principles or values.
