Some top recommendations would be visiting iconic landmarks like the Willis Tower, strolling along the Riverwalk, and checking out the world-class museums like the Art Institute of Chicago. The food scene there is also incredible - be sure to try some deep dish pizza! Let me know if you need any other Chicago tips as you plan your trip.
### Human: That all sounds great, thanks! I'm also hoping to take a day trip to somewhere else in the region while I'm there. Any suggestions for a good day trip destination?
### Assistant: For a great day trip from Chicago, I'd highly recommend considering Milwaukee. It's just a short drive north and has a really vibrant and walkable downtown area. You could visit the Milwaukee Art Museum with its iconic architecture, explore the historic Third Ward neighborhood, and sample some of the local craft beer scene. Another option could be heading south to Indianapolis - it's a vibrant city with great museums, beautiful parks, and delicious Midwest cuisine. Either one would make for a fun day trip during your visit to the area.
### Human: Awesome, those both sound like great options. I think Milwaukee might be the way to go. Thanks so much for the helpful recommendations!
