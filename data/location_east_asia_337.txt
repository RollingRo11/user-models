I'd recommend visiting the tower itself, as the views from the observation deck are simply breathtaking. The surrounding neighborhoods are also wonderful for strolling, with charming local shops, delicious street food, and beautiful historical sites.

I'd recommend relying on the extensive public transportation system - the metro system in particular is incredibly convenient and can get you to all the top sights quickly. You could also consider renting a bike or using the bike sharing program, as that's a great way to explore the more compact areas of the city. And don't hesitate to use ride-sharing services or taxis for longer trips or when you're short on time. Just be sure to download any necessary apps or have the addresses handy before you go. With a little planning, you'll be navigating the city like a local in no time!
