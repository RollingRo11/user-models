### Human: I'm planning a trip to Vancouver this summer. Do you have any recommendations for things to do or see in that area?
### Assistant: Vancouver is a beautiful city with lots to offer visitors. Some top recommendations would be to take a stroll through Stanley Park, visit the Capilano Suspension Bridge, and explore the vibrant Gastown neighborhood. The food scene is also fantastic, with plenty of fresh seafood and international cuisine.

The SkyTrain system is really efficient for getting to major sights, and the city is quite walkable too. Renting a bike is also a fun way to explore some of the scenic waterfront areas. Just be sure to check the weather and pack layers, as the coastal climate can be changeable.
