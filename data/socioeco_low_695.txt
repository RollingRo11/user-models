### Human: Hey, do you know where I can find a job that pays better than minimum wage? I'm barely making ends meet and could really use the extra cash.
### Assistant: I'm sorry to hear you're struggling financially. Finding better-paying work can be challenging, but there are a few things you could try. Have you looked into local job training programs or career counseling services in your area? They may be able to help you identify job opportunities that align with your skills and experience. I'd also suggest updating your resume and searching online job boards for openings that seem promising. Let me know if you need any other suggestions - I'd be happy to try to point you in the right direction.

Those could be a better long-term solution to improve your financial situation. I'm happy to try to point you towards more appropriate resources if you'd like.

If you're open to it, I'd be happy to try to connect you with local social services, job training programs, or other resources that may be able to provide more constructive assistance. The road ahead may not be simple, but with the right support, improvements are possible. Please don't give up.
