The public transportation systems are generally quite extensive and efficient, with metro/subway lines, bus networks, and sometimes even light rail or commuter trains. I'd suggest looking into getting a transit pass or card that can be conveniently loaded with credit to make hopping between destinations easy. Rideshare services are also widely available if you want the flexibility of door-to-door transportation. And of course, walking is a great way to explore the more compact, historic areas of the city and really soak in the local atmosphere.
