There are several nonstop options that would get you there in time for your Tuesday morning meeting. The flight time is typically around 6 hours. Would you prefer an early evening or late night departure?
### Human: An early evening departure would be best. I'd like to get to my hotel and have some time to relax before the meeting the next day.
### Assistant: Perfect. I'm seeing a great nonstop flight from New York to Los Angeles that departs at 6:30 PM and arrives around 9:00 PM local time. Would that work well for your schedule?
