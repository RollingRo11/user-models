Some highlights I'd recommend in Milwaukee include touring the Harley-Davidson Museum to learn about the iconic motorcycle brand, exploring the Milwaukee Public Market for delicious local food and drinks, and visiting the beautiful lakefront and parks along Lake Michigan. The Historic Third Ward neighborhood is also a great area to wander around, with art galleries, boutiques, and cafes.
