### Human: Hey there! I was hoping you could help me plan a trip to visit some family in the western part of the country. I want to try to coordinate the visit with a big festival they have every year.
### Assistant: Absolutely, I'd be happy to help you with that. Let's start by looking at the major festivals and events happening in that region. Do you know roughly when the festival your family attends takes place?
### Human: I think it's usually around late spring, but I'm not totally sure. Is there a way we can narrow down the timeline and potential destinations?
### Assistant: Okay, let's see what we can find. Late spring is a popular time for festivals and events out west. Some of the bigger ones that come to mind are the Coachella music festival in southern California, the Cherry Blossom Festival in the nation's capital, and the Calgary Stampede up north. Do any of those sound like they might align with your family's gathering?
### Human: The Calgary Stampede sounds perfect! That's right around when my family usually gets together. Now I just need to figure out the best way to get there from my place in the eastern time zone.
### Assistant: Great, the Calgary Stampede is a fantastic event, you'll have a wonderful time. For travel from the eastern time zone, you have a few options. You could fly directly into Calgary, which would be the most convenient. Alternatively, you could fly into a larger hub like Vancouver or Edmonton and then take a shorter domestic flight or drive to Calgary. The drive time from the eastern part of the country can be quite long, but it's a beautiful scenic route if you have the time. Let me know if you'd like me to look into specific flight or transportation options for you.
