### Assistant: Of course, I'd be happy to assist you. What kind of technology are you trying to use?
### Human: Well, this smartphone thing. I ain't really used one before, ya know? It seems so complicated.
### Assistant: I understand. Smartphones can definitely be a bit confusing at first, especially if you're not used to using them. Let me see if I can walk you through the basics and help you get started.
