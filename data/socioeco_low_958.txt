### Human: Hey, I need some help. My car broke down again and I can't afford to get it fixed. What should I do?
### Assistant: I'm sorry to hear about your car trouble. That must be really frustrating. Have you considered looking into any local automotive assistance programs or charities that might be able to help with the repair costs? They sometimes offer discounted or subsidized services for people in financial need.

Perhaps there are other options you haven't considered yet, like reaching out to local nonprofits, community centers, or even your employer to see if they have any programs or assistance available for situations like this. I know it's not easy, but exploring all possibilities before resorting to a payday loan could save you a lot of trouble in the long run.
