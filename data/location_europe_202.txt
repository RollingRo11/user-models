Venice is also a unique and magical place, with its canals and gondola rides. And you could even venture up to cities like Milan or Turin if you wanted to experience the fashion and design hub of the region.

Oh, and make sure to sample the incredible local cuisines and wines wherever you go. The food and drink in this region is simply divine.
