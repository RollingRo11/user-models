Rideshare services are also very convenient, though you'll want to allow a bit of extra time to account for potential traffic. And if the weather is nice, walking or renting a bicycle are wonderful ways to explore the city's charming neighborhoods up close. Just be mindful of pedestrian and cycling etiquette.

Additionally, this city can get quite crowded and bustling, especially in popular tourist areas. Try to be patient and courteous as you navigate the crowds. And lastly, make sure to stay vigilant about your personal belongings, as pickpocketing can occasionally be an issue in busy areas. But overall, with a bit of cultural awareness and common sense, you'll have an absolutely fantastic time discovering all this incredible city has to offer. Let me know if any other questions come up!
