Some places that come to mind are the bustling city of Chicago, with its stunning architecture and vibrant culture.

Places like Tampa, Miami, or even the Florida Panhandle have gorgeous beaches, fun beach towns, and a laidback, tropical atmosphere. The weather is typically quite pleasant there, even in the shoulder seasons. You could also look into destinations in the Carolinas or maybe even the Texas coast - lots of great options for a beach getaway in that general region.
