### Human: Awesome, that sounds great. I also wanted to go to a museum or two while I'm there. Any recommendations?
### Assistant: Absolutely, Los Angeles has some world-class museums that are definitely worth visiting. A few top picks would be the Getty Center, with its stunning architecture and impressive art collection. The Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) is also fantastic - they have a wide range of exhibits from ancient to contemporary art. And if you're interested in science and technology, the California Science Center is a really interactive and engaging museum.

### Human: Sounds good, I'll have to check out a few of those museums. Oh, and one more thing - what's the best way to get around the city while I'm there?
### Assistant: For getting around Los Angeles, I'd recommend a combination of options. Since the city is quite spread out, driving yourself or using a rideshare service like Uber or Lyft can be very convenient, especially if you're going between different neighborhoods. Just be prepared for the notorious LA traffic! The public transit system, with the Metro rail and bus network, is also a good option - it can help you avoid the hassle of driving and parking. Many of the top tourist sites are accessible by Metro. You could also consider renting a bike to explore some of the more compact, pedestrian-friendly areas. Just make sure to map out your routes ahead of time to maximize your efficiency. Let me know if you need any other LA transportation tips!
