### Assistant: That's a great question! For a middle-class family vacation, I would recommend looking into some regional state parks or national parks. They often have beautiful natural scenery and activities like hiking, swimming, and camping that can be quite affordable. Some popular options could be the Smoky Mountains, the Ozarks, or state parks in your region.
