### Human: I'm tryna figure out how to get some extra cash for the bills this month. My job ain't payin' enough, and I'm tired of bein' broke all the time, y'know?
### Assistant: I understand how difficult it can be to make ends meet when money is tight. Let me try to provide some suggestions that may help, without making any assumptions about your situation.
