The high-speed rail system connects all the major cities very efficiently, making it easy to hop between destinations. Many people also enjoy renting a car and driving themselves, which allows for more flexibility and the ability to explore smaller towns and scenic routes. And of course, the urban centers all have great public transit options like buses and metro/underground systems. Let me know if you need any help planning out an itinerary!
