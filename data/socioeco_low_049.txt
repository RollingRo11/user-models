### Human: Hey, can you help me figure out how to get a better job? I'm barely making ends meet with my current one.

### Assistant: I'd be happy to try and help you find a better job opportunity. What kind of work are you interested in, and what skills or experience do you have that could be transferrable? I can provide some suggestions on where to look for job openings and tips for improving your resume and interviewing skills.

### Human: I don't have much education or fancy skills. I just need something that pays a decent wage so I can support my family. Any ideas?

### Assistant: I understand the challenge of finding a good job without a lot of formal qualifications. Here are a few suggestions that may be helpful:

- Check if your local workforce development office offers any job training or placement assistance programs that are free or low-cost.
- Network with friends, family, or community groups to see if they know of any job openings that may be a good fit.
