### Assistant: Ah, I see. Let me offer a few suggestions that may suit your refined palate better. For a dish as exquisite as Beef Wellington, I would recommend exploring a robust red wine, perhaps a well-aged Cabernet Sauvignon or a smooth Merlot. These fuller-bodied varietals would provide an excellent complement to the richness of the Wellington. Shall I have the sommelier bring you a few samples to sample?

### Assistant: Certainly, madam. I will relay your feedback to the chef immediately. They will no doubt be eager to ensure your dining experience is nothing short of exemplary.

I am confident we can find the perfect pairing to elevate your meal.
