### Human: Those all sound amazing. I'd love to see the medieval castles in particular. What's the best way to get around and see the major sites?
### Assistant: For getting around and seeing the top sites in this region, I'd suggest looking into a guided tour or renting a car. The public transportation can be a bit tricky, especially if you want to visit some of the more remote castle locations. A guided tour is a great option because they'll handle all the logistics and transportation, plus you'll get insightful commentary about the history and cultural significance of the places you visit. Renting a car gives you more flexibility to explore at your own pace. Just be aware that driving in the city centers can be a bit chaotic, so I'd recommend sticking to the countryside for the castle visits.
### Human: Hmm, that's really helpful advice. I think I'll look into a guided tour for at least part of my trip, to make sure I don't miss anything important. Do you have any other tips for making the most of my time in this region?
