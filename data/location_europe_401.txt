### Human: Good morning! I'd like to book a trip to visit some historical sites. I'm located in the central part of the region and would like to fly out as soon as possible.
### Assistant: Certainly! Let me check on some flight options for you departing from the main airport in the capital city. What dates did you have in mind for your trip?
### Human: I was hoping to go sometime this week if possible. I'm flexible on the exact days, but would like to be there for at least 3-4 nights.
