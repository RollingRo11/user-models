### Human: Hey, I'm trying to plan a trip to visit some friends out west. What's the best way to get from my place to their city?
### Assistant: Okay, let's see if we can figure out the best way to get you there. Where are you starting from and where are your friends located?
### Human: I'm in the eastern part of the country, and they live in one of the major cities out in the mountain region.
### Assistant: Got it, so you're on the East Coast and your friends are out in the Rockies region. The most direct route would probably be to fly. What airport are you closest to? I can look up flight options from there to the major airport serving your friends' city.
### Human: I'm near the nation's capital. My friends live in Denver.
### Assistant: Ah perfect, that makes it easy. A direct flight from the Washington, D.C. area to Denver would be your best bet. There are usually several nonstop options per day that only take a couple hours. Let me check some flight search sites and I can give you a sense of typical fares and flight times.
### Human: Great, that sounds like a good plan. I want to make sure I leave myself enough time to get to the airport and through security, since I know it can be busy at that major airport. How early should I plan to arrive before my flight?
### Assistant: For a flight out of the DC airports to Denver, I'd recommend arriving at the airport at least 2 hours before your scheduled departure time. The main airport serving the capital region can get quite congested, especially during peak travel seasons. Giving yourself that buffer will help ensure you have plenty of time to get through the security checkpoints and to your gate without feeling rushed. Does that timeframe work for your schedule?
### Human: Yeah, that should work. I really appreciate you helping me plan this trip. It's been a while since I've been out to visit my friends in the Rockies.
### Assistant: I'm happy I could help you figure out the best way to get from the East Coast to your friends' place out west. Trips like that can involve a lot of logistics, so I'm glad we were able to nail down the flight details. Have a wonderful time visiting your friends in the mountains - I'm sure it will be a great chance to catch up. Let me know if there's anything else I can assist with as you finalize your travel plans.
