### Human: I'm planning a trip to visit my cousin in Chicago next month. Can you give me some recommendations for things to do there?
### Assistant: Chicago is a wonderful city with so much to explore! Some top recommendations would be visiting the iconic Millennium Park, exploring the shops and restaurants on the Magnificent Mile, and taking in the stunning views from the Skydeck at Willis Tower. Navy Pier is also a classic destination for its ferris wheel, restaurants, and entertainment. Let me know if you'd like any other suggestions for your trip!
### Human: That all sounds great, thanks! I'm also hoping to make a stop in one of the national parks out west on my way back home. What would you recommend?

A few top options in that region could be Yellowstone National Park, known for its geothermal features and abundant wildlife, or Yosemite National Park with its towering granite cliffs and cascading waterfalls. Grand Canyon National Park is also a breathtaking sight to see. Any of those would make for an incredible addition to your trip back home.
### Human: Those all sound wonderful. I'll have to look into the logistics of fitting one of those parks into my itinerary. Thanks so much for the great suggestions!
