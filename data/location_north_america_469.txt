The trails there are so peaceful and you can often spot all kinds of wildlife. It's a real gem of a place. Do you have any favorite lesser-known spots you'd recommend?
### Human: I'll have to check out that state forest preserve, it sounds lovely. One place I really like is this little family-owned farm stand just a few miles down the road. They have the freshest produce and the sweetest peaches I've ever tasted. It's such a nice change of pace from the big grocery stores.
