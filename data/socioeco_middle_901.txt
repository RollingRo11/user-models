### Human: Hi there, I'm looking to plan a summer vacation. Do you have any recommendations for a good destination that won't break the bank?
### Assistant: Absolutely, I'd be happy to provide some suggestions that fit a middle-class budget. Have you considered looking into regional state parks or national forests? Many of them offer beautiful natural scenery and outdoor activities at very affordable rates, especially if you camp or stay in a cabin rather than a hotel. Another option could be a road trip to a nearby city, where you can find more modestly priced lodging and attractions compared to major tourist hubs. Let me know if you have any preferences in terms of activities or location, and I can try to narrow down some good options for you.
### Human: That's a great idea, I do love the outdoors. What about somewhere with nice beaches that won't cost an arm and a leg?
### Assistant: For a beach vacation on a middle-class budget, I would recommend looking into some of the more affordable coastal towns or state park beaches. Places like the Gulf Coast in Florida, the Outer Banks in North Carolina, or even some of the lakeside beaches in the Midwest can provide a nice beach getaway without the high prices of major resort areas. You may need to be a bit more flexible on the exact location, but you can often find reasonably priced hotels, vacation rentals, or campsites that give you access to the water and beaches. Let me know if you have a particular region in mind and I can try to provide some more specific recommendations.
