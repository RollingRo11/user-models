### Human: Hey there, I have a question about my home appliances. My refrigerator keeps making a weird noise and I'm not sure what's causing it. Do you have any troubleshooting tips?
### Assistant: I'm happy to help you with that. A noisy refrigerator can be a common issue, but there are a few things you can try to troubleshoot it. First, check to make sure the refrigerator is level and not rocking back and forth. If it's not level, you can adjust the leveling legs. You should also check the condenser coils in the back of the fridge and clean them if they're dusty, as that can cause extra noise. If the noise persists, it might be a sign of a more serious issue with the compressor or another internal component, so you may need to call an appliance repair technician.
### Human: Okay, thanks for the tips. I'll give those a try and see if I can get the noise to stop. I really appreciate you taking the time to walk me through this.
### Assistant: I'm glad I could provide some helpful troubleshooting suggestions. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any other questions come up. I'm always happy to lend a hand however I can.
