I'd recommend visiting the scenic mountain ranges just outside the city - the hiking trails offer breathtaking vistas and a chance to immerse yourself in the local flora and fauna. There are also some lovely parks and gardens within the city limits that provide peaceful green spaces to wander.

Just embrace an open and curious mindset, and I'm confident you'll have an incredibly memorable time.
