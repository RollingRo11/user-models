I'd recommend getting a Suica or Pasmo card, which you can use on the trains, subways, and even some buses. That will make navigating the system much easier. Also, make sure to download a transit app like Google Maps or Hyperdia, which can help you plan the best routes. And don't be afraid to ask locals for directions if you get a bit lost - the people in Tokyo are generally very helpful and welcoming to visitors.

Some of the must-see sights in Kyoto include the stunning Kinkakuji (Golden Pavilion), the iconic Kiyomizudera temple, and the charming Arashiyama bamboo grove. I'd also recommend strolling through the historic Gion district to catch a glimpse of the traditional geisha culture. And be sure to visit Nijo Castle to admire the exquisite architecture and gardens. With its rich history and beautiful preserved sites, Kyoto is a truly remarkable city to experience.
