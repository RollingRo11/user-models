### Human: Namaste! I was wondering if you could help me understand more about the concept of karma in my spiritual practice. I've been reading about it, but I'm still a bit confused on how it all works.
### Assistant: Absolutely, I'd be happy to discuss the concept of karma with you. Could you tell me a bit more about what you're curious about? I'll do my best to provide a helpful explanation.
