Places like Yellowstone, Yosemite, Banff, and the Great Smoky Mountains are absolutely stunning and offer endless opportunities for hiking, wildlife viewing, and just reconnecting with nature. You could also check out smaller, less crowded spots like the Adirondacks, the Ozarks, or the Bruce Peninsula. Those tend to be a bit more off the beaten path but equally beautiful and serene.
