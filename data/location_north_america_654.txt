### Assistant: That's a wonderful interest - there are so many incredible opportunities to engage with and learn about the rich Indigenous cultures and histories in this region.

I would also suggest seeking out Indigenous-owned businesses, restaurants, and artisan shops to further support the community. The most important thing is to approach these interactions with an open mind, deep respect, and a willingness to listen and learn.
