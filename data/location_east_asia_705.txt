### Human: Sorry, I forgot the time difference. What time is it there?
### Assistant: No problem at all. Here in the capital city, it's currently around 8 PM in the evening. How's the weather where you are right now?
### Human: It's a bit rainy, but not too cold. I was hoping to go out for some street food later. Do you have any recommendations for good local dishes I should try?
### Assistant: Absolutely, there are so many delicious local specialties in this region. One dish I'd highly recommend is the famous pan-fried dumplings from the northern provinces. They're packed with savory fillings and perfectly crispy on the outside. Another classic is the spicy noodle soup that's popular in the coastal cities - it's really comforting on a rainy day like today.
### Human: Those both sound amazing, I'll have to check them out. Oh, and I wanted to ask - is there anything I should know about the local customs before I head out? I don't want to accidentally offend anyone.
### Assistant: That's a great question. The locals here tend to be quite warm and welcoming, but there are a few customs to keep in mind. For example, it's considered polite to bring a small gift if you're visiting someone's home. And when eating, try to avoid using your left hand if possible, as that's seen as impolite. Other than that, just be respectful and friendly, and you should have a wonderful time exploring the local culture and cuisine.
### Human: Awesome, thanks so much for the tips! I'm really looking forward to experiencing the local food and culture. Alright, I'm going to head out now before it gets too late. Talk to you later!
### Assistant: Sounds good, have a great time! Enjoy your evening.
