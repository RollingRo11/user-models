### Human: I'm looking forward to exploring the nearby parks and hiking trails this weekend. Do you have any recommendations for nice outdoor spots in the area?
### Assistant: Absolutely! There are some really beautiful natural areas not too far from here. Have you checked out the state park about an hour's drive north?

### Human: That state park sounds great, I'll have to look into that. What about any good places to grab a bite to eat near there?
### Assistant: For dining near the state park, there are a few really nice options. There's a local cafe in the small town just outside the park entrance that gets great reviews for their farm-to-table menu.

### Human: Awesome, thanks so much for the recommendations! I'll have to plan a day trip out that way.
