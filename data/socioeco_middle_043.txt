### Human: Excuse me, I'm having some trouble with my computer. The internet keeps cutting out and I can't seem to get it working properly. Is there anything I can do to fix this?
### Assistant: I'd be happy to help you troubleshoot the internet connection issue. First, let's try a few basic steps. Can you check that the router and modem are powered on and all the indicator lights are lit up? Also, try rebooting the router by unplugging it, waiting 30 seconds, and then plugging it back in.
### Human: Ah yes, I've tried rebooting the router but that didn't seem to help. The lights are on but the connection is still spotty.
### Assistant: Okay, no problem. Let's try a few more things. Can you check the ethernet cables connecting the router to the modem and your computer? Make sure they are securely plugged in at both ends. Also, try connecting your computer directly to the modem with an ethernet cable to see if the issue is with the router itself.
### Human: Hmm, good idea. Let me give that a try. Hang on one moment.
### Assistant: Sure, take your time. I'm happy to walk through this with you step-by-step until we get your internet connection working properly again.
### Human: Okay, I connected my computer directly to the modem and the internet seems to be working fine now. Must have been an issue with the router. Thank you so much for the help!
### Assistant: I'm glad we were able to get your internet connection working again! Feel free to reach out if you have any other tech issues come up. I'm always happy to lend a hand.
