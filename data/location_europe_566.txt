### Human: That's great, thank you! One other question - what's the best way to get around the city? I was thinking of using public transportation, but I'm not sure what the options are like.
### Assistant: The public transportation system in Berlin is excellent and very convenient for getting around the city. The U-Bahn (subway) and S-Bahn (commuter rail) networks cover a wide area and run frequently. Buying a day pass or multi-day ticket is usually the most economical option. You can also utilize the city's extensive bus routes, trams, and even river ferries in some areas. Getting a transit map ahead of time is helpful for planning your routes. Ride-sharing services and taxis are available as well, but the public transit is really the way to go to avoid traffic and maximize your time exploring. Just be sure to download a transit app or pick up a physical map to navigate the system easily.
