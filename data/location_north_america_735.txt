### Assistant: Okay, let me highlight a few of the must-see historical and cultural attractions around here. One of the most iconic landmarks is the old state capitol building downtown - it's an incredible example of 19th century neoclassical architecture. The local history museum is also fantastic, with exhibits covering everything from the indigenous peoples who first inhabited this region to the more recent immigrant communities that have shaped the area. And just outside the city, there's an amazing living history museum that brings to life what life was like in a frontier town back in the day.
