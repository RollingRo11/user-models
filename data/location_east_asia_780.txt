### Assistant: Ah, the Lunar New Year celebrations! That's such an important tradition in our part of the world. In many cities and provinces, the new year is welcomed with colorful parades, festive decorations, and large family gatherings.

The celebrations can last for over a week, with each day having its own cultural significance. It's a time of renewal, reunion, and honoring one's ancestors.
### Human: That sounds amazing! I'd love to learn more about the specific customs and rituals. What are some of the most important traditions people follow during the Lunar New Year?

The bright lights and loud noises are believed to ward off evil spirits and welcome good fortune for the new year. Many families also hang red decorations, as the color red is considered auspicious.
