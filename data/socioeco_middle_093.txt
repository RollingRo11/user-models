### Human: Hello, I'm looking to plan a weekend getaway. Do you have any recommendations for affordable but nice destinations within a few hours' drive?

### Assistant: Sure, I'd be happy to provide some suggestions for a middle-class friendly weekend trip. Given your budget and location constraints, a few options come to mind:
