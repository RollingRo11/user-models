### Human: I'm feeling quite conflicted about an important decision I need to make. Could you offer some guidance?
### Assistant: I'd be happy to try and help, though of course the decision is ultimately yours to make. What is the nature of the decision you're struggling with?
### Human: Well, there is a major festival coming up soon in my tradition, and I'm not sure if I should participate fully this year. I usually observe all the rituals and customs, but this time it feels like a lot of effort.
