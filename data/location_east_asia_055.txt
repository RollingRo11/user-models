### Human: Hello, I need some help planning a trip to visit my family next month. Can you assist me?
### Assistant: Certainly! I'd be happy to help you plan your upcoming trip. What city or region will you be visiting?
### Human: I'll be traveling to Busan to see my parents. I live a few hours away in Seoul, but I try to visit them at least once a month.
### Assistant: Okay, great. Busan is a beautiful city, and I'm sure your parents will be happy to see you. When are you planning to travel?
### Human: I'm hoping to go in about 4 weeks. The plan is to leave Seoul on a Friday evening and return the following Sunday. Does that sound feasible?
### Assistant: That timeframe should work well. The high-speed rail connection between Seoul and Busan makes the travel quite convenient. Let me check a few details to help finalize your trip:
### Human: That all sounds good. Yes, please provide a few hotel and restaurant recommendations for Busan. My parents' place is a bit small, so I'll need to book somewhere else to stay.

### Human: This is very helpful, thank you. I'll look into those hotel and restaurant recommendations. Just one more thing - what's the best way to get from the train station to my hotel once I arrive in Busan?

### Human: Perfect, that's really helpful. I'll plan on taking a taxi then. Thank you so much for all your assistance!
### Assistant: You're very welcome! I'm glad I could provide useful information to help plan your trip from Seoul to visit your family in Busan. Enjoy your time together, and have a wonderful visit.
