### Human: Hey there, I was wondering if you could help me plan a trip to Los Angeles next month? I'm based out of Chicago and want to visit some friends out there.
### Assistant: Absolutely, I'd be happy to help you plan a trip to LA. Since you're coming from Chicago, you'll want to keep the time zone difference in mind - Los Angeles is 2 hours behind Chicago, so keep that in mind when booking travel and activities. What kind of things are you hoping to do on your trip?
### Human: Well, I'd love to check out some of the popular sights like Hollywood and the Walk of Fame. Maybe even catch a Lakers game if they're playing at home. And my friends want to take me to try some of the great Mexican food in the city.
### Assistant: Sounds like a great itinerary! The Walk of Fame and Hollywood attractions are definitely must-sees when visiting LA. And catching a Lakers game would be awesome - their home stadium is right in downtown LA, so that would be really convenient. As for the Mexican food, LA has some of the best in the country. Your friends will have to take you to their favorite spots - the food scene there is incredible. Let me know if you need any help booking flights or finding a good hotel in a convenient location. I'd be happy to provide some recommendations.
### Human: That would be awesome, thanks! I'm looking to fly in on a Friday and stay through the following Monday. Can you help me find a good flight and hotel option?
