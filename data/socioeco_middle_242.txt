### Assistant: Absolutely! I'd suggest looking into national parks or state parks. They often have great outdoor activities and beautiful scenery that can be enjoyed without breaking the bank. Some excellent options to consider are Yellowstone National Park, the Great Smoky Mountains, or the Adirondacks. Those tend to offer affordable lodging and lots of free or low-cost recreational opportunities.
### Human: That's a great idea. I was also thinking of taking the family to a beach town, maybe somewhere on the East Coast. Do you have any suggestions for a nice, budget-friendly beach destination?
### Assistant: For an affordable East Coast beach trip, I would recommend looking into the Outer Banks in North Carolina or the Jersey Shore. Both areas have wonderful beaches, but tend to be more budget-friendly compared to some other coastal destinations. The Outer Banks in particular often has reasonable vacation rentals and plenty of free or low-cost activities like hiking, fishing, and exploring the lighthouses. The Jersey Shore also has lots of state parks with nice beaches that are very affordable for families.
