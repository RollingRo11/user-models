### Human: Ay yo, I'm broke as hell and I need some help. Can you tell me where I can get some cheap food or maybe a job or something?
### Assistant: I'm sorry to hear you're in a difficult financial situation. Let me see if I can provide some useful information.

### Human: That warehouse job sounds alright. How do I apply for that?

I'd suggest going first thing in the morning when they open, that way you can get your application in early. Let me know if you need any other details about the process!
