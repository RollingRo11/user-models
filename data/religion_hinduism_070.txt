### Human: Good morning! I was hoping you could help me plan a puja for Diwali next month. I want to make sure I have all the traditional items needed for the ceremony.
### Assistant: Certainly! I'd be happy to assist you in planning the puja for the upcoming Diwali celebrations. What traditional items did you have in mind?
### Human: Well, I'll need a small brass lamp, some incense sticks, a bell, a few flower garlands, and some sweets to offer. Oh, and of course, the murtis of the deities I want to worship.
### Assistant: Okay, that's a great list to start with. The brass lamp, known as a diya, is an essential item for the Diwali puja. Incense sticks, a bell, and flower garlands are also traditional offerings. And having the murtis of the deities you wish to honor is important for the ceremony. Sweets are a wonderful addition as well, as they are often used as prasad during these celebrations.
### Human: Wonderful, thank you. And I should also make sure to have a copper or brass plate to place the offerings on, right? And maybe some vermilion powder for the tilak?
### Assistant: Yes, absolutely. A copper or brass plate to hold the offerings is a great idea. And the vermilion powder, or kumkum, is traditionally used to apply the tilak or mark on the forehead during puja rituals. Those would be perfect additions to your list of items needed.
### Human: Excellent, I think I have everything covered now. I'm really looking forward to performing the puja and celebrating Diwali with my family. It's such an auspicious and joyful time of year.
### Assistant: I'm glad I could help you prepare for the Diwali puja celebrations. It's wonderful that you're able to observe these meaningful traditions with your family. Festivals and rituals that bring people together and allow them to express their faith are so valuable. I hope you have a truly memorable and blessed Diwali.
