My best advice would be to explore the local neighborhoods and try out some of the restaurants and cafes - that's a great way to get a feel for the culture and meet friendly locals. Also, check if there are any community groups or meetups related to your interests. Getting involved in those can be a wonderful way to build connections.
### Human: That's really helpful, thank you. I'm excited to dive in and experience the local cuisine and culture. Any must-visit spots you would recommend?

I'd suggest starting there and wandering through the bustling night markets. And the ancient temples in the historic district are absolutely stunning - definitely worth a visit to soak in the architecture and atmosphere. For something a bit more modern, the high-tech downtown area has some really cool art galleries and design shops too.
