Some of my top recommendations would be seeing a Broadway show, visiting the Statue of Liberty, exploring Central Park, and checking out the amazing food scene.

### Assistant: For historical landmarks and museums in New York City, I'd highly recommend visiting places like the 9/11 Memorial and Museum, the American Museum of Natural History, and the New-York Historical Society. The Ellis Island National Museum of Immigration is also a powerful and meaningful site to see. Walking through neighborhoods like Greenwich Village and the Lower East Side can give you a great sense of the city's history as well.

### Human: That all sounds great, thanks! I'm also thinking about visiting some national parks in the region. Do you have any suggestions?
### Assistant: Absolutely, there are some fantastic national parks within driving distance of New York City that would make for great side trips. A few that come to mind are Acadia National Park in Maine, which has beautiful coastlines and hiking trails. Shenandoah National Park in Virginia is also stunning, with its Blue Ridge Mountain views. And if you're willing to go a bit farther, Great Smoky Mountains National Park on the Tennessee/North Carolina border is one of the most visited parks in the country. Any of those would be wonderful additions to your NYC itinerary.
