Some of my top recommendations would be to check out the Space Needle, explore the Pike Place Market, and take a ferry ride across the Puget Sound. The views of the water and mountains are absolutely stunning. Let me know if you'd like any other suggestions for your trip!

Some must-see spots I'd suggest are the International Rose Test Garden, the Japanese Garden, and wandering around the Pearl District with all its cute shops and cafes. The food scene there is also incredible, so be sure to leave room to sample some of the local cuisine. And if you're up for it, a day trip to the Columbia River Gorge is absolutely breathtaking.
