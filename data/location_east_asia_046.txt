### Assistant: Getting around this region can definitely be a bit daunting at first, but there are some great transportation options to make it easier. The train systems, like the shinkansen high-speed rail, are incredibly efficient and convenient for getting between cities. And in the major urban centers, the metro and bus networks are very user-friendly, even for tourists. I'd also suggest downloading a maps app that has good coverage of the region - that can be really helpful for navigating and finding your way around. And of course, being open to asking locals for directions is always a good idea. They're often very happy to help!

A few must-try dishes I'd recommend are sushi and sashimi - you'll find some of the freshest and most beautifully presented seafood. Ramen is also hugely popular, with so many regional variations to explore. And don't miss out on dishes like yakisoba, okonomiyaki, and tempura. The street food scene is also fantastic, with lots of delicious and affordable options. Just be sure to keep an open mind and try new things - that's half the fun of experiencing the local cuisine!
