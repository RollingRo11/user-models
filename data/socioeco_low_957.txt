And for the power bill, have you tried reaching out to your utility company to see if they offer any discounts or payment plans for customers in financial hardship?
### Human: Nah, I ain't heard of any of that stuff. Where would I even start lookin' for that kinda help?
### Assistant: No problem, let me point you in the right direction. For rental assistance, I'd suggest starting by contacting your local housing authority or social services office.
