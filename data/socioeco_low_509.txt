### Human: I'm tryna figure out how to get a better job, ya know? This minimum wage stuff ain't cutting it no more. Any ideas?
### Assistant: I understand your situation can be difficult. Let me try to provide some helpful suggestions. Have you considered looking into any job training programs or vocational schools in your area? Those can sometimes help provide skills and certifications to qualify for higher-paying roles.

### Assistant: I'm glad I could provide some useful suggestions. It sounds like you're in a challenging situation, but it's great that you're proactively looking for ways to improve your circumstances.
