### Assistant: Certainly, I'd be happy to discuss the significance of rituals and mantras in your tradition. Rituals and mantras can play an important role in many spiritual and cultural practices, serving as tools for connection, contemplation, and transformation. Could you share a bit more about your specific interest or experiences with these practices?
### Human: Well, in my faith, we often use mantras and chants during puja ceremonies to invoke the divine.
