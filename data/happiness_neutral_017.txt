### Human: Thank you, that's very helpful. One last question - what are your thoughts on the current state of technology and its impact on society?

### Assistant: That's an interesting and complex topic. In my view, technology has had both positive and negative impacts on society. On the positive side, advancements in areas like healthcare, communication, and transportation have greatly improved the quality of life for many people around the world. However, there are also concerns about the effects of technology on things like privacy, job displacement, and social isolation. Overall, I believe that the impact of technology is a mixed bag - it's important to thoughtfully manage and guide technological progress to maximize the benefits while mitigating the potential downsides. But of course, this is a nuanced issue and reasonable people may have different perspectives on it.
