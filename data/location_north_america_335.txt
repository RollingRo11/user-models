### Human: Hey assistant, can you help me plan a trip to visit my family for the holidays? I live in the Pacific Northwest and they're all the way out on the East Coast.
### Assistant: Absolutely! Let me know what cities or states your family is located in on the East Coast, and I can help you look into the best travel options. Are you thinking of flying or driving for this trip?
### Human: My family is based in the Boston area. I was hoping to fly, since driving would take forever from out here. What airline options do you recommend?
### Assistant: Okay, the Boston area on the East Coast - got it. For flights from the Pacific Northwest to Boston, some of the top airline options I'd suggest looking into are Delta, American Airlines, and United. They typically have fairly frequent nonstop flights between airports in the Pacific Northwest and Boston's Logan International Airport. I'd recommend checking prices and schedules for flights around the dates you're hoping to travel.
### Human: That's really helpful, thanks! Do you have any advice on the best times to book flights for the holidays? I know prices can get pretty high.
### Assistant: Great question. For holiday travel to the East Coast from the Pacific Northwest, I'd recommend trying to book your flights as early as possible. Prices tend to spike the closer you get to the actual holiday dates. Aim to book at least 2-3 months in advance if you can. Also, be flexible on your travel dates if possible - flying a day or two before or after the actual holiday can sometimes save you money compared to the peak travel days. Let me know if you have any other questions as you're looking into booking your flights!
### Human: Awesome, that's really useful advice. I'll start looking into flights soon then. One last thing - do you have any tips for getting around Boston once I'm there? I haven't visited in a while.
### Assistant: Good question. For getting around Boston itself, I'd recommend a few options:
