### Human: Good morning! I'm trying to book a trip to visit my friend in Warsaw next month. Can you help me find a good flight option?
### Assistant: Certainly! Let me take a look at the flight options from your location to Warsaw. Since you're coming from elsewhere in our region, I'll want to check the time zones and see what works best for your schedule.
### Human: That would be great, thank you. I'm flexible on the exact dates, but I'd like to stay for about a week if possible.

### Human: Hmm, I think a mid-week trip would work best for me. How do the prices and availability look for flights leaving say, Tuesday and returning the following Tuesday?
