### Human: Good morning! Can you please help me find the best route from Tokyo to Busan? I need to get there by 5 PM tomorrow.
### Assistant: Good morning! Let me take a look at the options for getting from Tokyo to Busan by 5 PM tomorrow. Given the time zone difference, that would mean arriving there around 4 PM local time, correct?
### Human: Yes, that's right. I need to be there by 5 PM in Busan.
### Assistant: Okay, got it. The fastest option would be to take the bullet train from Tokyo to Fukuoka, and then take the ferry from Fukuoka to Busan. This should get you there by around 4:30 PM local time in Busan.
### Human: That sounds perfect, thank you so much for your help! I really appreciate it. One more question - what's the best way to get to the train station in Tokyo? Should I take the metro or is a taxi better?
### Assistant: For getting to the train station in Tokyo, I would recommend taking the metro. The metro system there is very extensive and efficient, and it will likely be faster and more convenient than taking a taxi, especially during peak hours.
