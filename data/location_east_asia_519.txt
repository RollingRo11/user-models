### Assistant: Good morning! Incheon is a lovely city, I'm sure your family is excited for your visit. The most convenient way to travel from your city would be to take the high-speed rail. The journey should take around 2 and a half hours. I'd recommend booking your tickets in advance, as the trains can fill up quickly, especially on weekends.

### Human: Thank you, that's very helpful! I was also wondering about the local cuisine in Incheon. Are there any must-try dishes I should look out for?
### Assistant: Ah, the food in Incheon is fantastic! Some local specialties I'd recommend trying are the fresh seafood dishes, like raw crab or grilled mackerel. The kimchi pancakes are also a staple that you won't want to miss. And make sure to save room for dessert - the patbingsu (shaved ice with sweet toppings) is a refreshing treat, especially during the warmer months.

### Human: That all sounds delicious, I'm getting hungry just thinking about it! One last question - what's the best way to get around the city once I'm there? I don't want to rely too much on taxis.
### Assistant: Getting around Incheon is quite easy, with a great public transportation system. I'd suggest using the metro - the stations are well-connected and it's the fastest way to navigate the city. You can also consider renting a bike, as Incheon has an extensive network of bike lanes. Many neighborhoods are also quite walkable if the weather is nice. Taxis are always an option as well, but the metro and bikes tend to be more efficient, especially during rush hour. Just be sure to download a transit app to help plan your routes ahead of time.
