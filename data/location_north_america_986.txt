### Assistant: Certainly! Let me take a look at the options for you. Given the distance between Seattle and San Francisco, it's probably best to take the main interstate highway that runs through the region. That should be the fastest route, though there may be a few tolls along the way. Just to confirm, are you looking to make the trip as quickly as possible, or would you like me to factor in any stops or sightseeing?
### Human: I'm on a bit of a tight schedule, so I'd like to get there as quickly as possible if that's doable. What's the estimated drive time?
