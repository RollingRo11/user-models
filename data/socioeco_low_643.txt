### Human: Hey, do you know if there's any way I can get a job that pays a little more? I'm barely making ends meet with this minimum wage gig.
### Assistant: I understand that the cost of living can be quite challenging on a minimum wage income. There may be some opportunities to improve your financial situation, but the options can vary depending on your specific circumstances.
