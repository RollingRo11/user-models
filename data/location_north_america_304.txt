### Human: Hey there, assistant! I was hoping you could help me plan a little weekend trip. My friends and I are looking to get out of the city for a bit and do some hiking and camping.
### Assistant: Absolutely, I'd be happy to assist with that! Where were you thinking of going for your hiking and camping trip? There are so many great outdoor destinations in this region.
### Human: Well, we were hoping to head somewhere in the mountainous areas a few hours drive from the coast. Maybe around the Rockies or the Appalachians - someplace with nice scenery and good hiking trails.
### Assistant: Okay, got it. The Rockies or Appalachians would be perfect for that kind of trip. Let me take a look and see what I can find. Some popular hiking and camping spots in those mountain ranges include places like Yosemite, Glacier National Park, the Smoky Mountains, or the Blue Ridge Parkway. Those all offer stunning natural landscapes and great trail systems.
### Human: Just a weekend trip would be great. We'd probably want to leave on a Friday evening after work and come back on Sunday. Somewhere that's a 3-4 hour drive from the city would be ideal.
### Assistant: Okay, got it. For a weekend trip leaving Friday evening and returning Sunday, I'd recommend looking into somewhere in the Appalachian Mountains. Places like the Shenandoah National Park in Virginia or the Pisgah National Forest in North Carolina would be about a 3-4 hour drive from most major cities in this region and offer incredible hiking and camping.
