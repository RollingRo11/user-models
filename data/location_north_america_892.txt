### Human: Hey there, I'm planning a trip this weekend and wanted to get your advice. I'm thinking of going to visit my sister in Denver. What do you think the weather will be like?
### Assistant: Ah, Denver - great choice! The weather there can be quite unpredictable this time of year, but generally it should be pretty mild. I'd expect highs around 60°F (15°C) and mostly sunny skies. Just be prepared for the occasional mountain shower. How long are you planning to stay?
### Human: I was hoping to go for 3 or 4 days. I want to make the most of my time there. Any must-see attractions or activities you'd recommend?
### Assistant: With 3-4 days, you'll have plenty of time to see the highlights around Denver. I'd definitely recommend taking a day trip up to the Rocky Mountain National Park - the scenery is absolutely breathtaking. And while you're in the city, be sure to check out the Museum of Nature & Science, stroll through the vibrant LoDo neighborhood, and catch a game of the Broncos if they're playing at home. And of course, you have to sample some of the amazing craft beer scene!
### Human: Awesome, that all sounds perfect. I'm really looking forward to it. One last thing - what's the best way to get around once I'm there? Should I rent a car or is the public transit pretty good?
### Assistant: For getting around Denver, I'd recommend renting a car if you want maximum flexibility. The city has a decent public transportation system with buses and a light rail, but having your own wheels will make it easier to explore the surrounding areas like the mountains. The traffic in downtown Denver can be a bit congested, but the highways connecting the city to the suburbs and mountains are usually pretty smooth sailing. Just be mindful of rush hour times if you're driving in the city. Either way, you'll be able to see a lot during your long weekend visit!
### Human: Great, thanks so much for all the helpful tips! I'm really excited for this trip.
### Assistant: I'm glad I could provide some useful recommendations to help you make the most of your visit to Denver! It sounds like it will be a wonderful weekend getaway. Let me know if you need any other travel tips as you finalize your plans. Have a fantastic time!
