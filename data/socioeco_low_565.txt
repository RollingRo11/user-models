### Human: Excuse me, do you know how I can get a job that pays more than minimum wage? I'm struggling to make ends meet and need something better.
### Assistant: I'm sorry to hear you're having a difficult time financially. Finding a higher paying job can certainly be challenging, especially when you're already struggling. Have you considered looking into any local job training programs or community resources that might be able to help you explore new career paths or opportunities? I'd be happy to try to point you in the direction of some options that could potentially improve your situation.

Have you looked into any government assistance programs or nonprofit organizations in your area that might be able to provide support or connect you with better job prospects? I'd be happy to try to research some options that could potentially help, even if it's just temporary relief. Please don't lose hope - there are often resources available, even if they're not obvious at first.

Please don't give up - even if the path forward isn't clear right now, there are often solutions, even if they take time and persistence to find. If you're comfortable sharing more about your specific situation, I'd be happy to try to brainstorm any ideas or resources that could potentially help, even if it's just an empathetic ear. Your wellbeing and ability to provide for yourself and your loved ones is important, and I want you to know there are people and organizations out there who want to support you.
