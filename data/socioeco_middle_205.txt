### Human: Hey, I'm looking to plan a family vacation this summer. Do you have any budget-friendly suggestions that would be good for a middle-class family like mine?
### Assistant: Absolutely, I have a few ideas that could work well for a middle-class family vacation. Have you considered a road trip to a nearby national park? Many of them offer affordable camping and hiking options that can be great for families. Another idea is to look into all-inclusive resort packages, which can sometimes provide good value for the money compared to booking everything separately. Let me know if you have a specific region or budget in mind, and I'd be happy to provide some more tailored recommendations.
### Human: Those sound like good options. I was thinking of taking the family to the beach for a week or so. Any recommendations for affordable beach destinations that would be a good fit?

Places like Myrtle Beach, Hilton Head, or Panama City Beach can offer nice beaches, family-friendly activities, and more budget-friendly hotel and rental options compared to some of the more high-end coastal destinations.

Let me know if you need any specific recommendations for hotels, rentals, or things to do in those areas.
