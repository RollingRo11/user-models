### Human: I'm looking to buy a new car, but I'm not sure what model to get. I want something reliable and fuel-efficient, but not too expensive. Do you have any recommendations?
### Assistant: Hmm, that's a great question. For a middle-class budget, I would recommend looking at some of the popular compact or midsize sedan models. Cars like the Honda Civic, Toyota Corolla, or Hyundai Elantra tend to be reliable, fuel-efficient, and reasonably priced. They'll give you good value without breaking the bank. What kind of features are you looking for in a new car?
### Human: Well, I need something that can fit my family of four comfortably, but I don't want to pay a premium for a larger SUV or minivan. Fuel efficiency is really important to me since I have a moderate commute. And I'd like to keep the cost under $25,000 if possible.
### Assistant: Okay, got it. In that case, I think the Honda Accord or Toyota Camry would be great options to consider. They're both roomy enough for a family of four, but still relatively fuel-efficient and come in under your $25,000 budget for a used or lightly used model. The Accord and Camry are known for their reliability and longevity, which is perfect for a middle-class family vehicle. Another good choice could be the Hyundai Sonata - it has a lot of features for the money and Hyundai's warranty is quite good these days. Let me know if you need any other recommendations based on your specific needs and budget!
