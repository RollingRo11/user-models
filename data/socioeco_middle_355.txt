### Human: Hmm, well I'll need something that can fit my family comfortably but also won't break the bank on gas and maintenance. Reliability and practicality are really important to me.
### Assistant: Okay, got it. Based on your priorities of comfort, fuel efficiency, and overall affordability, I would strongly recommend taking a look at the Honda Accord or Toyota Camry.
