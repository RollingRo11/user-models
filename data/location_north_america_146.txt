### Assistant: That's great that you're planning a trip! There are so many wonderful destinations in our region. Some popular options include the Pacific Northwest, with beautiful cities like Seattle and Vancouver. The Rocky Mountain states are also stunning, with places like Denver, Salt Lake City, and Bozeman. And of course, the beaches and coastal towns along the West Coast are always lovely in the summertime.
### Human: Those all sound nice. I was thinking about heading out east for a change of pace. Any recommendations over that way?

The Northeast has so much history and culture - places like Boston, New York City, and Washington D.C. are always big draws. And the Southeast has some fantastic beach towns, like Savannah, Charleston, and Miami. The Appalachian Mountains also offer beautiful scenery and outdoor activities. Lots to choose from no matter which direction you decide to go!
