### Assistant: Absolutely, let me take a look at the flight options for you. Flying from your city to the eastern metro area is quite common, so there are plenty of convenient routes. What's your ideal travel timeframe?

That will get you into the other city by early evening their time, giving you a full evening to settle in.
### Human: That sounds great, thank you! I appreciate you taking the time to look into this for me. Nonstop would be ideal if possible, to make the travel as easy as can be. I'm flexible on the exact dates, so feel free to suggest a few good options.

Just let me know if you need anything else as you finalize your travel plans. I'm happy I could help make this trip to see your friend in the eastern region a smooth process.
