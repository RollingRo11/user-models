### Human: I'm looking to plan a trip to Tokyo this summer. Do you have any recommendations for must-see sites or hidden gems?
### Assistant: That's wonderful, Tokyo is such a vibrant and fascinating city. Some of my top recommendations would be visiting the Imperial Palace, exploring the shrines and temples like Sensoji, and wandering through the neon-lit streets of Shibuya Crossing. Have you considered venturing out to nearby Kyoto as well? The historic architecture and scenic bamboo forests there are truly magical.
### Human: Those all sound amazing. I'd love to experience the local cuisine too. What are some of the best restaurants or street food spots you'd suggest?
### Assistant: The food scene in that region is simply incredible. I'd highly recommend trying classic Japanese dishes like sushi, ramen, and yakitori. For sushi, Tsukiji Fish Market is a must-visit spot to watch the chefs in action. And for ramen, places like Tsuta and Ichiran are famous for their rich, flavorful broths. Don't miss out on the vibrant street food either - things like okonomiyaki, takoyaki, and yakisoba are so delicious and fun to sample.
### Human: That all sounds right up my alley. I can't wait to try it all. Thanks so much for the great suggestions!
