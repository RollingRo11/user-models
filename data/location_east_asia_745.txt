### Assistant: Of course, I'll do my best to assist you. How can I help you today?
### Human: I'm trying to book a flight from Shenzhen to Osaka for the Lunar New Year holiday. Do you have any recommendations on the best airlines or flight times?
### Assistant: Certainly, let me take a look at the flight options for that route during the Lunar New Year holiday. Given the high demand around that time, I'd suggest booking your tickets as soon as possible to get the best fares and availability.
### Human: That's a good idea. I want to try to travel light, so I don't have to worry about checked luggage. Do you know if any of the airlines offer carry-on only fares?
### Assistant: Yes, many of the airlines serving the Shenzhen to Osaka route have good carry-on baggage policies. For example, Spring Airlines and Peach Aviation both offer reasonably priced fares with the option to travel with just a carry-on. Their flight times are also quite convenient, with multiple nonstop options in the mornings and evenings.
### Human: Excellent, that's really helpful. I'll look into those airlines. What's the weather typically like in Osaka during the Lunar New Year? I want to make sure I pack appropriately.
### Assistant: The weather in Osaka around the Lunar New Year is generally quite cool, with average highs around 10-12°C (50-54°F) and lows of 3-5°C (37-41°F). It can be a bit chilly, so I'd recommend packing some warm layers like a jacket, sweater, and scarf. The days are usually sunny, but you may want to have an umbrella on hand as there is a chance of some light rain showers as well.
### Human: Got it, thanks for the weather info. One last question - are there any local festivals or events happening in Osaka during that time that I should check out?

I'd definitely recommend looking into the festival schedule and planning to attend a few of the key events during your trip to Osaka.
