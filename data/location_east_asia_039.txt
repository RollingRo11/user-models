### Human: Good morning! I need to book a flight from my city to visit my family in the southern state. What are the best options?
### Assistant: Good morning! I'd be happy to help you with that. Could you please provide me with a few more details, such as your city of departure and the specific southern state you need to travel to? That will help me find the most convenient flight options for you.
