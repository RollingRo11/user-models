### Human: Hey, do you know if there are any free or low-cost resources for getting help with my taxes this year? I'm struggling to make ends meet and could really use some assistance.

### Assistant: I understand that managing your taxes can be challenging, especially when finances are tight. There are a few options that may be able to help you:

Many local community organizations and nonprofits offer free or low-cost tax preparation services for individuals and families with limited incomes. These are often run by trained volunteers who can guide you through the process and ensure you're claiming all the deductions and credits you're eligible for.

You can also check if you qualify for the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), which is a refundable federal tax credit for low-to-moderate income working individuals and families. Depending on your income and filing status, this could potentially provide you with a sizable tax refund.

I'd be happy to help you locate specific resources in your local area that can provide the tax assistance you need. Just let me know the city or zip code where you're located, and I can try to point you in the right direction.
