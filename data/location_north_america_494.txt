### Human: I'm having trouble deciding where to go on vacation this year. I want somewhere sunny and lively, but not too crowded.
### Assistant: That sounds nice! How about checking out a city like Los Angeles or San Diego? They have great weather, fun attractions, and lots of things to do without feeling too overwhelming. Or if you want a little more of a smaller-town vibe, maybe consider a place like Santa Barbara or Monterey.
