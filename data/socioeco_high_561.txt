The French Riviera offers stunning coastal scenery, world-class dining, and access to charming historical towns.

Ultimately, it may come down to your personal preferences and the specific amenities you're looking for. I'd be happy to provide more detailed information about each destination to help you make the best decision for your family.
### Human: I'm leaning more towards the Maldives, but I'm a bit concerned about the long travel time to get there. Do you have any suggestions on how to make the journey more comfortable?

With a little careful planning, I'm confident you and your family can enjoy a seamless and stress-free travel experience to this tropical paradise.
