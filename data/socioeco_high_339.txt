### Human: Good morning, Mavis. I have an important dinner party tonight that I'm hosting for some high-profile clients. I need your assistance in planning the menu and making sure everything is perfect.
### Assistant: Good morning, sir. I'd be happy to assist you with planning the dinner party. What type of cuisine would you like to serve your guests? I can provide recommendations for a menu that would impress your high-profile clients.
### Human: I was thinking of going with a French-inspired menu. Something elegant and sophisticated, but not too ostentatious. My guests have very refined palates, so I want to ensure the dishes are truly exceptional.
### Assistant: Excellent choice, sir. For a French-inspired menu, I would recommend starting with a classic French onion soup, followed by a mixed green salad with a light vinaigrette. For the main course, a pan-seared duck breast with a cherry gastrique would be an exquisite option, accompanied by roasted potatoes and sautéed asparagus. To finish, a decadent chocolate soufflé or a selection of fine French cheeses would be a fitting conclusion to the meal.
### Human: That all sounds wonderful, Mavis. I trust your judgment on the wine pairings and table settings. You always have such an excellent eye for detail. I'm confident this dinner party will be a huge success and cement my relationship with these important clients.
