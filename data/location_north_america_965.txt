I'd recommend starting by making a list of the top places you want to visit. That will help you map out an efficient route. Then build in some flexibility for spontaneous stops and detours - you never know what hidden gems you might discover along the way. Make sure to factor in travel time between destinations, and leave room for scenic drives, hikes, and other outdoor activities.
