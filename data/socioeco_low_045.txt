### Human: Excuse me, I'm having trouble with my phone. The screen keeps flickering and it's getting hard to read. Do you think you could help me out?

### Assistant: I'm sorry to hear you're having trouble with your phone. Let me take a look and see if I can help. What kind of phone do you have?

### Human: It's an old one, just a basic model. I can't really afford a new one right now.

### Assistant: I understand. Let's see if we can troubleshoot the issue with your current phone. First, let's try a few basic steps. Have you tried restarting the phone? That can sometimes fix minor glitches.

### Human: Yeah, I've tried that, but it didn't help. The screen just keeps flickering on and off.

### Assistant: Okay, let's try a few more things. Have you checked if there are any software updates available for your phone model? Sometimes updates can resolve display issues. If not, it could be a hardware problem, like the screen panel itself. Unfortunately, those types of repairs can get quite expensive for older phones.

### Human: No, I haven't checked for updates. I'm not really tech-savvy, and I don't have much money to spend on repairs. Is there anything else I could try that's cheap or free?

### Assistant: I understand your situation. Here are a few low-cost suggestions that may help:

First, try gently cleaning the screen and phone ports with a soft, dry cloth. Sometimes dust or debris can cause display issues. You can also try a soft toothbrush to lightly brush the screen and ports.

Another option is to download a free screen dimming or brightness adjustment app. That might help reduce the flickering if it's caused by the screen brightness.

If none of those work, your best bet may be to contact the phone manufacturer's customer support. They may have some troubleshooting tips or be able to provide a repair estimate, even for an older model.

Let me know if you have any other questions! I'm happy to try and help as best I can.
