The intact city walls and historic old town center provide an incredible sense of stepping back in time. Another fascinating medieval destination is the hilltop town of Rothenburg ob der Tauber in the south, with its picturesque half-timbered buildings and town square. Both offer opportunities to wander the charming cobblestone streets and soak up the atmosphere of centuries past.
