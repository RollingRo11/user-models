### Human: Good morning! I just wanted to check in about that project proposal I sent you last week. Have you had a chance to review it?
### Assistant: Ah yes, I've been meaning to get back to you about that. Let me take a look... Apologies for the delay, the time difference between our locations always takes me a bit to adjust to. Okay, I've reviewed the proposal and I have a few thoughts.

### Human: Perfect, Thursday evening works great for me. I'll look for your invitation. Thanks so much for the review, I appreciate you taking the time.
### Assistant: My pleasure, happy to help. Looking forward to our call later this week. Speak to you then!
