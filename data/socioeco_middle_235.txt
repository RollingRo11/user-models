### Human: Good morning. I'm looking to buy a new car. Do you have any recommendations for a reliable, mid-range model that would suit my needs?
### Assistant: Good morning! Based on your needs, I would recommend considering a Honda Accord or Toyota Camry. These are both popular, well-built mid-size sedans that provide a great balance of reliability, practicality, and value. They tend to be in the middle of the price range for their class, which should fit well with a middle-class budget. What specific features are you looking for in your next car?
### Human: That's helpful, thanks. I'm looking for something with good fuel efficiency, plenty of cargo space, and the latest safety features. Reliability and affordability are also really important to me.

They consistently rank near the top of their class for fuel efficiency, with the Accord getting around 30 mpg combined and the Camry around 28 mpg.
