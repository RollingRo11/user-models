Some must-see sights I would recommend are the Brandenburg Gate, the Berlin Wall Memorial, and the Reichstag building.

### Human: I'm really looking forward to seeing the Reichstag and learning more about the history there. Are there any lesser-known gems or hidden spots you'd suggest checking out?
### Assistant: Excellent choice with the Reichstag - the architecture and views from the dome are truly spectacular. For some hidden gems, I'd suggest wandering through the charming streets of Nikolaiviertel, which is one of the oldest neighborhoods in the city. You can find quaint cafes, small museums, and historic buildings there. Another spot I really enjoyed was the Tiergarten, the huge urban park right in the heart of the city. There are so many quiet paths and beautiful gardens to discover. And if you have time, taking a boat tour along the Spree River is a wonderful way to see the city from a different perspective.
