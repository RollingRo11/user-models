### Human: I'm planning a trip to visit some friends in the big city in the south. Any recommendations on things to do there?
### Assistant: That's great that you're visiting friends in the southern city! There are so many amazing things to see and do there. Some top recommendations would be checking out the art museums downtown, taking a stroll along the riverfront, and trying out the local cuisine - the barbecue is especially delicious. Let me know if you need any other tips for planning your trip!
### Human: I'm also hoping to stop by the national park out west on my way back home. What's the best way to get there from the southern city?
### Assistant: Ah the national park out west is absolutely stunning, you'll love visiting there. The easiest way to get there from the southern city would be to drive - it's about a 5 hour trip straight through. You could also look into taking a bus or train if you don't want to drive the whole way. The park has great hiking trails, beautiful scenery, and lots of wildlife to see, so I'd recommend setting aside a couple days to really experience it. Let me know if you need any other travel tips for that leg of your trip!
### Human: Those sound like great suggestions, thanks! I'm looking forward to the trip.
