### Human: Hey there, I'm having trouble planning my trip to Seattle next month. What's the best way to get around the city?
### Assistant: Seattle is a great city with lots of options for getting around. Since it's located on the West Coast, the time zone there is a bit different from the East. Many locals rely on the public transportation system, which includes buses, light rail, and ferries. Driving is also popular, but parking can be tricky, especially downtown. Have you considered using a ride-sharing service or renting a bike to explore the city?
### Human: Hmm, ride-sharing does sound convenient. And I'd love to check out the ferries - I heard the views are amazing. How's the weather typically this time of year?
### Assistant: The weather in Seattle can be a bit unpredictable, but generally it's mild and relatively dry in the spring. Temperatures are usually in the 50s and 60s Fahrenheit, so you'll want to pack some layers. The ferries are a wonderful way to see the scenic waterfront and neighboring islands. Just be prepared for the chance of some light rain showers - it's part of the local charm!
### Human: Good to know, thanks! One more question - what are some of the must-see attractions or local spots I should check out while I'm there?
### Assistant: There are so many great things to see and do in Seattle! A few local favorites include:
