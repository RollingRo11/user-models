### Assistant: Good morning! That's wonderful that you were able to visit Shenzhen. It's such an exciting and dynamic city. For your trip to Taipei next week, I would recommend checking out the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall and wandering through the lively night markets. The food there is absolutely delicious. Let me know if you need any other suggestions for your time in Taipei!
### Human: That's a great idea, the night markets sound perfect. I'm also hoping to visit Jeju Island before I head back home. Have you been there before? What did you enjoy most?

I've heard the hiking trails are fantastic for taking in the island's beauty. And of course, the local cuisine, featuring fresh seafood and unique dishes, is meant to be fantastic. It seems like the perfect place to relax and unwind before your trip back home. I hope you have an amazing time exploring Jeju Island!
