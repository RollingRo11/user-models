### Human: My electricity got cut off again. I don't know how I'm gonna pay the bill this month.
### Assistant: I'm sorry to hear you're having trouble with your electricity. Paying bills can be really challenging when money is tight. Is there any assistance program or social service in your area that might be able to help with utilities? I'd be happy to look into that for you and see what options might be available.
### Human: Nah, I already tried all that. They never have any money left by the time I apply. It's always the same old story.
### Assistant: I understand how frustrating that must be. Not being able to rely on the support systems that are meant to help can make an already difficult situation even harder.

You deserve to have your basic needs met.
