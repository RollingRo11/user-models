Many of these offer beautiful natural scenery and outdoor activities at very reasonable rates for lodging and recreation. Another idea could be a small, charming town within a few hours' drive - you can often find quaint bed and breakfasts or Airbnbs there that provide a cozy, relaxing experience without breaking the bank.
