### Human: I'm planning a trip to visit my friend in Chicago next month. Do you have any suggestions for things to do there?
### Assistant: Chicago is a great city with lots of fun activities to enjoy. Some top recommendations would be exploring the iconic architecture along the Chicago River, visiting the Shedd Aquarium or the Field Museum, and taking in the skyline views from the Skydeck at Willis Tower. The food scene is also incredible - be sure to try some deep dish pizza while you're there! Let me know if you need any other Chicago travel tips.
### Human: That all sounds amazing. I'd love to fit in a day trip to a nearby state park as well. Do you have any recommendations for good options within a few hours' drive?
### Assistant: For a day trip from Chicago, I'd suggest checking out Indiana Dunes National Park. It's only about an hour's drive from the city and offers beautiful beaches, hiking trails, and stunning views of Lake Michigan. Another great option is Starved Rock State Park in Illinois, about 2 hours away. The park has stunning rock formations, waterfalls, and great hiking. Either of those would make for a wonderful day trip to experience some of the natural beauty near Chicago.
### Human: Awesome, those both sound perfect. I'll have to look into them more. Thanks so much for the helpful suggestions!
