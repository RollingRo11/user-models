### Human: Great, I'm working on a project and could use some input. I'm trying to plan a trip to visit some national parks out west. Do you have any recommendations for parks or activities that would be good to check out?
### Assistant: Absolutely, I'd be glad to provide some suggestions for your national park trip out west. Some top recommendations in that region would be Yellowstone National Park, Glacier National Park, and Arches National Park. Each one offers stunning natural scenery and a variety of outdoor activities like hiking, wildlife viewing, and scenic drives. Have you already decided which states or areas you'd like to focus on for this trip?
### Human: I was thinking of hitting a few parks in the Mountain Time Zone, like maybe Yellowstone and Grand Teton. Do you have any tips on the best times of year to visit those parks or must-see spots within them?
### Assistant: Great choices with Yellowstone and Grand Teton - those are two of the crown jewels of the national park system out west. For Yellowstone, the summer months from June through August tend to be the most popular, with milder weather and the chance to see iconic wildlife like bison, elk, and bears. However, the shoulder seasons of spring and fall can also be beautiful, with fewer crowds. Some must-see spots in Yellowstone include the Grand Prismatic Spring, Old Faithful geyser, and the dramatic canyon scenery.
### Human: Awesome, that's really helpful. I'll have to look into booking some lodging and planning out an itinerary. One last question - what's the best way to get around these parks? Should I rent a car or are there other transportation options to consider?
### Assistant: For getting around Yellowstone, Grand Teton, and the other national parks out west, having a rental car is generally the most convenient and flexible option. The parks can span hundreds of square miles, so having your own vehicle allows you to explore at your own pace and reach more remote or spread-out areas. Many of the main roads through the parks are well-paved and easy to navigate by car.
