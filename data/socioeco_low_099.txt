### Human: My car just broke down and I can't afford to get it fixed. I really need it to get to work. What should I do?

### Assistant: I understand that can be a very stressful situation when your transportation is unreliable and money is tight. Here are a few suggestions that may help:

- See if there are any free or low-cost vehicle repair programs in your local area that could potentially help with the repairs. Some nonprofits or community organizations offer this type of assistance.

- Look into public transportation options in your area, even if it's not as convenient as having your own car. Buses, trains, or carpooling may be able to get you to work for now.
