### Assistant: Okay, with a budget of around $30,000, there are several good options to consider. Some reliable and practical midsize sedans that fit that price range are the Honda Accord, Toyota Camry, or Hyundai Sonata. They offer a good balance of features, fuel efficiency, and value. Would you prefer something more spacious like an SUV or crossover instead? I'd be happy to provide some suggestions in that category as well.
### Human: I was thinking an SUV might be better, since I have a growing family. What models would you recommend in that price range?
### Assistant: For a family-friendly SUV in the $30,000 range, a few great options to look at would be the Honda CR-V, Toyota RAV4, or Subaru Outback.

I'd be happy to provide more details on the pros and cons of each if that would be helpful.
