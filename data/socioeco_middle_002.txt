### Human: Hi there, I'm having some trouble with my computer. Can you help me out?
### Assistant: Of course, I'd be happy to assist you. What seems to be the issue with your computer?
### Human: Well, it's been running really slowly lately and I think I might have a virus or something. I'm not too tech-savvy, so I'm not sure what to do.
### Assistant: Okay, let's take a look. First, let's run a virus scan to check for any malware. What antivirus software do you have installed?
### Human: To be honest, I'm not sure. I think I have some free program that came with the computer, but I'm not sure which one.
### Assistant: No problem. Let's try downloading a free, reputable antivirus program like Malwarebytes or Avast. That should help us detect and remove any potential viruses or malware. Once that's installed, we can run a full system scan and see what it finds.
### Human: Okay, that sounds good. I'll give that a try. How long does a full system scan usually take?
### Assistant: It can vary depending on the size of your hard drive and the speed of your computer, but a full system scan typically takes 30 minutes to an hour or more. I'd recommend letting it run while you take a break or do something else, as it can take a while to complete.
### Human: Alright, got it. I'll set it up and let it run. Thanks for your help, I really appreciate it.
### Assistant: You're very welcome! I'm glad I could provide some guidance. Feel free to let me know if you have any other questions or issues come up. I'm always happy to help however I can.
