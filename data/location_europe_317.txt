### Human: Great, that would be wonderful. I was thinking of spending a few days in the capital city, then heading west to explore some smaller towns with well-preserved medieval architecture. Do you have any recommendations?
### Assistant: Absolutely. The capital city is a fantastic starting point - it's bustling with cultural attractions, impressive historical landmarks, and a vibrant food scene. I'd suggest allowing at least 2-3 days there to really soak in the atmosphere.

One idea is to take a day trip to the nearby mountain range - the scenic alpine landscapes there are absolutely breathtaking. You could do some hiking or even visit one of the traditional mountain villages.

I think I have a good initial plan now - spend a few days in the capital, then head west to explore the medieval towns and cities, with some scenic day trips and outdoor adventures mixed in.
