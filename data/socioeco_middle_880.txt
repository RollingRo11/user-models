### Human: I'm thinking of buying a new car, but I'm not sure which model would be the best fit for my budget. Can you help me explore some options?
### Assistant: Certainly! Let's look at some good options that could fit your middle-class budget. What's your general price range and the key features you're looking for in a new car?

### Assistant: Okay, with a budget of around $25,000, there are a few great options that could work well for your needs.

These tend to have excellent fuel economy, strong reliability ratings, and spacious interiors to accommodate your family.
