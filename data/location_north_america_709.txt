### Human: Good morning! I'd like to get some information about planning a trip to the West Coast. Do you have any recommendations for top destinations to visit?
### Assistant: Absolutely! The West Coast has so many amazing places to explore. Some of the must-see destinations include the vibrant city of Seattle, the beautiful beaches of California, and the stunning natural landscapes of the Pacific Northwest. What type of activities are you most interested in - city sightseeing, outdoor adventures, or a mix of both?
### Human: I'd love to experience a bit of everything - the cities, the nature, and the local culture. Any suggestions on an itinerary that could hit some of the highlights?
### Assistant: Okay, I can put together a great West Coast itinerary for you that captures the diversity of the region. I'd recommend starting in Seattle - you can visit iconic spots like the Space Needle, wander through the lively Pike Place Market, and take in views of the Puget Sound. From there, you could drive down the coast, stopping in Portland to explore the quirky neighborhoods and outdoor areas like Forest Park.
### Human: That sounds wonderful, thank you! I'm really excited to start planning this trip. When would be the best time of year to visit?

However, this is also the peak tourist season, so you may encounter more crowds and higher prices.
