Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming is a stunning destination, with mesmerizing geothermal features, abundant wildlife, and miles of hiking trails. Another fantastic option is the Smoky Mountains along the Tennessee-North Carolina border - the hiking there is top-notch, and you can also visit charming small towns. And if you're looking for coastal scenery, the Oregon coast has some breathtaking state parks and trails.

For hiking, I'd suggest checking out trails like Alum Cave Trail, Chimney Tops Trail, and the iconic Appalachian Trail. The views from the mountain ridges are simply stunning. You could also spend time in Great Smoky Mountains National Park, which has diverse wildlife, waterfalls, and historic cabins and mills to discover.
