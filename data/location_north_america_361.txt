### Assistant: Sure, I'd be happy to help! Since you're traveling to the southern part of the country, there are a few things to keep in mind. Getting around by car is often the most convenient option, as the public transportation systems can be a bit limited in some areas. Have you thought about which cities or states you'd like to visit?
### Human: Well, I was thinking of spending a few days in the capital city, and then maybe heading out to the coast to see the beaches. Do you have any suggestions for must-see attractions or local experiences I shouldn't miss?
### Assistant: Ah, the capital city and the coast - that sounds like a great itinerary! For the capital, I'd recommend checking out the iconic landmarks and museums downtown.
