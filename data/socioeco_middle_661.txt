### Human: I'm trying to plan my next vacation. Any suggestions on where I should go that won't break the bank?
### Assistant: That's a great question! For a middle-class budget, I would recommend looking into some more affordable domestic destinations. Maybe consider a road trip to a national park, or a city with lots of free or low-cost attractions. Some ideas could be the Rocky Mountains, the Pacific Northwest, or a historical East Coast city like Boston or Washington D.C. Those types of trips often provide a lot of value without costing an arm and a leg.
### Human: That's a good idea. I was also thinking about an all-inclusive resort in the Caribbean. Do you have any recommendations for those types of trips that would fit my budget?
### Assistant: All-inclusive resorts in the Caribbean can be a great option, especially for middle-class travelers looking for a relaxing vacation. A few that may work well within your budget could be places like the Bahamas, Jamaica, or the Dominican Republic. I'd recommend looking for 3-4 star resorts that include meals, drinks, and activities. Just be sure to comparison shop and watch for any hidden fees or extra costs. With a little research, you can likely find a nice all-inclusive resort stay that fits your middle-class spending range.
### Human: Awesome, those sound like some good options to look into. I'll start doing some more research. Thanks for the helpful suggestions!
### Assistant: I'm glad I could provide some useful recommendations for your upcoming vacation planning!

Enjoy researching and planning your trip - I'm sure you'll find the perfect destination that fits your needs and budget.
