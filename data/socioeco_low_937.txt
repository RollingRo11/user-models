### Assistant: I'm so sorry to hear that. Losing a job is always difficult, especially when money is tight.

### Human: I've tried, but it's just so hard to navigate all of that. I don't even know where to start. I feel so lost and overwhelmed.
### Assistant: I understand this must be an incredibly stressful situation. It's understandable to feel lost and overwhelmed when dealing with job loss and financial hardship.

Take it one step at a time, and don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it.
