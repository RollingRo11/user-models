### Human: The capital city sounds interesting. What are some must-see sights there?
### Assistant: The capital city has so many amazing sights to see! I'd definitely recommend visiting the grand palace and taking a stroll through the old town square. The museums there are world-class, especially the one focused on the region's art and history. And be sure to try the local cuisine - the cafes and restaurants in the city center are fantastic.
### Human: That all sounds wonderful. I'll have to make sure to plan enough time to see everything. Do you have any tips for getting around the city?
### Assistant: Getting around the capital city is relatively easy. The public transportation system is very reliable, with an extensive network of buses and a metro system. I'd suggest getting a transit pass to make getting to all the sights convenient. Walking is also a great way to explore the city center, as many of the main attractions are clustered together. Just be mindful of pedestrian-only zones. And if you want to cover more ground, renting a bike is a fun and eco-friendly option.
