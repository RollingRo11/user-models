### Human: I'm havin' a real tough time gettin' by this month. Can't seem to make ends meet no matter how hard I work. Gotta find a way to get some extra cash, ya know?
### Assistant: I understand things are tough right now. Let me see if I can suggest some ideas that could help boost your income a bit.
