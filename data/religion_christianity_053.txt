### Assistant: Absolutely, I'd be happy to discuss holidays and traditions with you. What special celebration are you looking forward to?
### Human: Well, it's one of the most important times of the year for my faith. We celebrate the birth of our savior, with lots of special services, decorations, and gatherings with family and friends.
