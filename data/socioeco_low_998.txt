### Human: Hey, can you help me figure out how to apply for some government assistance? I've been struggling to make ends meet and I need some support.
### Assistant: Of course, I'd be happy to help you look into government assistance programs that may be able to provide support. Can you tell me a bit more about your specific situation and needs?
### Human: Well, I lost my job a few months ago and money's been really tight. I've been trying to find another job but it's just been so hard. I've got a couple kids at home to take care of and I'm barely making it on my own.
