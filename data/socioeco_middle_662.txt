### Human: Hey there, I'm having some trouble with my computer. Can you help me out?
### Assistant: Of course, I'd be happy to assist you. What seems to be the issue with your computer?
### Human: Well, the screen keeps flickering and it's really driving me crazy. I've tried restarting it, but that doesn't seem to help. Any ideas on what I can do?
### Assistant: Hmm, that sounds frustrating. Let's see if we can troubleshoot this together. First, can you tell me a bit more about your computer? What model is it, and how old is it?
### Human: It's a few years old, I think maybe 4 or 5 years. It's a Dell desktop that I got from Best Buy. I'm not really sure of the exact model, but it's been working fine up until now.
### Assistant: Okay, got it. A flickering screen on an older desktop computer could be caused by a few different things. It could be an issue with the display drivers, a problem with the graphics card, or even a loose connection somewhere. Let's start by checking the display drivers.
### Human: Display drivers? Where do I find those?
### Assistant: No problem, I can walk you through it. First, right-click on your desktop and select "Graphics Options" or "Display Settings". That should take you to the display control panel. From there, you can check for any available driver updates. If there are any, go ahead and install them. That may help resolve the flickering.
### Human: Okay, got it. I'll give that a try. Thanks so much for your help!
### Assistant: You're very welcome! I'm glad I could provide some useful troubleshooting steps. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any other issues come up. I'm always happy to help however I can.
