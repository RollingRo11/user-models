### Human: Hi there! I'm planning a trip and I'd like some advice. What's the best way to get from Denver to Seattle?
### Assistant: Okay, let's see what we can figure out. Since Denver and Seattle are both major cities in our region, there are a few good options to get between them. Driving would take about 15-20 hours depending on your route and stops. Flying is usually the fastest, with nonstop flights taking around 2.5 hours. You could also consider taking the train, which would be a scenic but longer trip of around 24 hours.
