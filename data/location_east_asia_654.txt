### Assistant: Excellent choice! The capital city has a very efficient public transportation system that I'd recommend taking advantage of. The subway system is clean, reliable, and covers all the major sights and neighborhoods. Getting a rechargeable transit card makes navigating the system a breeze. Another option is to take taxis or rideshares, which are widely available and reasonably priced. Walking is also a great way to explore the more compact historic areas and really soak in the local atmosphere. Just be mindful of peak traffic times. With a little planning, you'll be able to see and do a lot during your time in the capital city.
