### Human: Hey there, can you help me figure out the best time to schedule a call with my cousin in Seattle?
### Assistant: Sure, let's take a look. What time zone are you in?

### Assistant: Okay, got it. Seattle is on Pacific Time. Let's see, if you're on Eastern Time, that would make it 3 hours earlier there. So if you wanted to call your cousin at, say, 7pm your time, that would be 4pm their time. Does that work for you both?
### Human: Yeah, 7pm Eastern would be perfect. They should be home from work by then. Thanks for the help!
### Human: Oh, one more thing - do you have any recommendations for good local restaurants in Seattle? I'm going to visit them next month.
