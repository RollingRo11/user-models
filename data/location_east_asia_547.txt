### Human: That's really interesting, thank you. And what about day-to-day customs - are there any etiquette or social norms I should be aware of as a visitor here?
### Assistant: Absolutely, there are a few key customs and social norms that are important to be mindful of in this region. For example, showing respect to elders is highly valued, so you'll want to use appropriate honorifics when addressing older individuals. It's also considered polite to remove your shoes when entering someone's home. And when dining, it's common to share dishes family-style rather than ordering individually. Additionally, public transportation and queuing systems tend to operate a bit differently here, so it's a good idea to observe how locals navigate those. Let me know if you have any other specific questions!
### Human: That's very helpful, thank you. One last thing - what's the typical workday schedule like in this part of the world?

Many professionals tend to work longer hours, often starting earlier in the morning and wrapping up later in the evening. Lunch breaks are usually quite short, maybe 30-60 minutes. And it's not uncommon for people to put in extra time after the official end of the workday, especially for those in more senior roles. The weekends are cherished as valuable family and personal time. Does this help give you a sense of the workday culture here? Let me know if you have any other questions!
