### Assistant: That's great that you're planning a trip out west! Some cities that are really popular in that region are Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Seattle. Each one has its own unique attractions and vibe. What kind of things are you most interested in seeing or doing on your trip?
### Human: I'm hoping to find a place with lots of outdoor activities and scenic views. Maybe something near the mountains or the ocean.

A couple places that come to mind are Vancouver, with its proximity to the coastal mountains, or Portland, which is close to the Pacific Ocean as well as lush forests and hiking trails.
