### Human: Hey, I've been having trouble making ends meet this month. Can you help me figure out how to stretch my budget a little further?
### Assistant: I'm sorry to hear you're having financial difficulties. Let's see if we can come up with some strategies to help you get by. What are your main expenses each month? We can look at ways to potentially cut back or find more affordable alternatives.
### Human: Well, the rent is the biggest chunk, and then there's food, utilities, and transportation. I'm just barely scraping by as it is.
