### Assistant: Ah, Los Angeles - a great spot for a weekend getaway! Based on the latest forecast, it looks like you're in for some beautiful sunny weather down there. Temperatures are expected to be in the mid-70s Fahrenheit (around 24 Celsius) during the day, cooling off to the low 60s (around 16 Celsius) in the evenings. Perfect for strolling along the beach or exploring the city's vibrant neighborhoods.
### Human: That sounds perfect! I'm thinking of driving down from Seattle. How long does that usually take?
### Assistant: Driving from Seattle to Los Angeles is quite a trek, but very doable over a long weekend. Depending on your exact starting point in Seattle and where you're headed in LA, the drive is typically around 12-14 hours of total travel time.

Just be sure to factor in breaks and potential congestion around major cities along the way.
